According to a recent IDC Study, 95% of businesses who responded see the need to adopt a digital-first strategy and the majority of organizations are already moving down the path of executing their plans. However, to achieve top-line growth, organizational efficiency and deliver digitization at a pace to meet customer demands, organizations must realize that a robust API strategy is a prerequisite.\n\nOrganizations rely on hundreds, sometimes thousands of APIs, and the number of APIs within organizations is growing rapidly in IT departments and in lines of business. It should come as no surprise that APIs play a crucial role in enabling digitization. They provide the foundation for modernization and help organizations build successful business ecosystems. APIs link together individual systems that contain data about clients, partners, products, business performance and more.\n\nThey help organizations scale operations by providing a convenient and standardized means of sharing data and services. API management should not be viewed as just another piece of technology, but rather the basis of an organization’s digital strategy.\n\nAs businesses grow, keeping track of all the APIs available for use, socialization and monetization can become more challenging. This may increase the likelihood of security issues, since unknown APIs are possibly unsecure, out of date and provide a potential breach point. A robust API management solution is designed to allow organizations to monitor API lifecycles, boost socialization and optimize monetization efforts across the entire business ecosystem, while driving digitization at scale.\n\nAs more and more organizations are deploying API management solutions on cloud to improve mobility and accelerate the API development cycle, IBM offers IBM API Connect and IBM App Connect as a Service on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.\n\nIn this session, you will learn how to create a trial account to access API Connect and App Connect as a service on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud.\n\n***\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n- You need to have an OpenShift environment with GitOps operators. For this session, your proctor will provide you a pre-installed environment, with admin access (more details below). If you want to create your personal environment, check this <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SmDE80vuP3w\" target=\"_blank\">video</a> or follow the preparation section from this <a href=\"https://github.com/sko-master/multi-tenancy-gitops/blob/master/doc/sko-scenario.md\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>.\n- You need to have installed in your machine:\n  - <a href=\"https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.8/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html\" target=\"_blank\">oc CLI</a> v4.6+.\n  - github CLI\n  - Bash Shell\n  - JAVA v8+\n  - <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/api-connect/10.0.x?topic=configuration-installing-toolkit\" target=\"_blank\">apic CLI</a>\n\nNote some of the tools will be available after you deploy an instance of the capability you are working on. And you also need an account in the folllowing email service to configure APIC:\n  - <a href=\"https://mailtrap.io/\" target=\"_blank\">mailtrap</a>\n***\n\n## 1 - Start your IBM API Connect trial on AWS\n\n1. Open the trial registration page here and log in with your IBMid, or if necessary create a new one.\n![](images/api-connect-aws-1.png)\n\n2. After you log in, click **Continue** to start your trial creation.\n![](images/api-connect-aws-2.png)\n\n3. Select the best **AWS region** for your trial (1), define an **instance name** (e.g.: yourname-demo) (2) ands click **Continue** (3).\n![](images/api-connect-aws-3.png)\n\n4. In few minutes, you trial should be ready. Click on **Access your trial now**.\n![](images/api-connect-aws-4.png)\n\n5. First time, you will see a Welcome to API Connect dialog. You are welcome to explore the options. Feel free to see a **Product overview** (1), if necessary. When done, **close** (2) the Welcome dialog to access the API Connect home screen.\n![](images/api-connect-aws-5.png)\n\n6. Great, now you are on API Connect home screen. Here you can easily create, manage, secure and socialize APIs.  Now, let's create the IBM App Connect to develop integration flows. Click on **Develop integration flows with OpenAPI using App Connect**. If you don't see this tile, click here to access the App Connect trial registration page.\n![](images/api-connect-aws-6.png)\n\n\n***\n\n## 2 - Start your IBM App Connect trial on AWS\n\n1. **Log in** with your IBMid, or if necessary create a new one.\n![](images/ace-aws-1.png)\n\n2. Select the best **AWS region** for your trial (1), define an **instance name** (e.g.: yourname-demo) (2) ands click **Continue** (3).\n![](images/ace-aws-2.png)\n\n3. In few minutes, you trial should be ready. Click on **Access your trial now**.\n![](images/ace-aws-3.png)\n\n4. First time, you will see a Welcome to IBM App Connect Designer dialog. You are welcome to explore the options. Feel free to start a product tour(2). When done, **close** the Welcome dialog to access the IBM App Connect Designer home screen.\n![](images/ace-aws-4.png)\n\n5. Great! Here you are on the App Connect Designer Home screen, you are ready to start to create flows!\n![](images/ace-aws-5.png)\n\n***\n\n## Summary\n\nYou have successfully completed this lab.
