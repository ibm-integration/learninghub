Then, you can use the OpenShift CLI (oc) to manage the resources within your OpenShift cluster, such as projects, pods, and deployments.\r\n\r\n  Run the command below to install the IBM Cloud CLI.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -sL https://ibm.biz/idt-installer | bash\r\n```\r\n\r\n  ![](images/17-cloudpak-cli.png)\r\n\r\n2.To verify that the CLI and Developer Tools were installed successfully, run the help command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nibmcloud dev help\r\n```\r\n\r\n  ![](images/18-cloudpak-cli.png)\r\n\r\n3.Log in to IBM Cloud with your IBMid using the command below to guarantee that you will select your personal account (not DTE account).\r\n\r\n```\r\nibmcloud login -sso -r us-south -g default -c <your_ibm_id>\r\n```\r\n\r\n  Follow the URL in the prompt to get the one-time passcode.
