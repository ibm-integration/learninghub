APIs serve as the essential connector between different data sources and applications, which means that businesses are relying on and creating more APIs than ever before to get the data they need to power their applications and experiences.\n<br/><br/>\nGraphQL has rapidly become a go-to query language for companies to interact with their data and is emerging as a new standard for APIs, layering upon the investments in REST APIs and data systems. While GraphQL APIs are significantly easier for the application teams to consume, they can represent a challenge to the API Provider teams tasked with building them.  We believe that APIs built declaratively are simply better - leading to first implementation with fewer lines of clean code, faster time to deploy, and APIs with built-in performance, cost, and reliability optimizations.\n<br/><br/>\nOur company decided to invest in GraphQL as a new standard for APIs. GraphQL is a query language for APIs that gives an application client greater control over what data it retrieves in an API request when compared with a REST API request.\n<br/><br/>\nWe would like to explore an easier way for developers to build GraphQL APIs, consuming data stored everywhere. Take an e-commerce application for example. With a single call, GraphQL can merge data that is found in different subsystems, like customer information, order numbers, and delivery status, and return it in an expected format. While GraphQL APIs are significantly easier for the application teams to consume, they can represent a challenge to the API teams tasked with building them, securing them, socializing them, and managing them. To ease the process of building these APIs, we would like to explore a way to create GraphQL APIs using a declarative approach for federated access to data.\n<br/><br/>\nOn the other hand, our Development's team is having problems managing the use of GraphQL APIs in your company, including rate limits, API lifecycle, security and how to socialize these APIs with our developers ecosystem.\n<br/><br/>\nIn this demo we will learn how to move from Zero to Enterprise in the GraphQL domain. Initially we will learn how to use API Connect Essentials (StepZen) to create a a federated GraphQL API by pulling data from disparate sources (REST API and MySQL). After that you will use IBM API Connect to create a GraphQL API proxy definition that proxies a backend GraphQL server from StepZen, and to define rate limiting controls that reflect the amount of data that is returned from the server by a request to the GraphQL API.\n<br/><br/>\nHere we will see how to CREATE, MANAGE, SECURE and SOCIALIZE our GraphQL APIs using IBM API Connect solutions.\n<br/><br/>\nLet's get started!<br/><br/>\n\n(Demo Slides <a href=\"https://github.com/ibm-integration/learninghub/blob/main/src/pages/demos/mq-techsales/files/APICSlides.pptx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>)\n<br/>\n\n\n### **1 - Setup StepZen**\n\n<details>\n<summary>1.1 - Access StepZen</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nStepZen enables developers to easily build, and deploy a single GraphQL API that gets the data they need from multiple backends. The StepZen CLI is the primary tool for creating, uploading, deploying and testing your StepZen API. The StepZen CLI enables you to manage your StepZen schemas, configurations, and endpoints. The CLI also comes with a built-in Schema Explorer that enables you to explore and test the API you’ve deployed locally from your browser.\n\n\nWe already installed StepZen CLI here. Now we need to get the details about our StepZen account. For this demo we are using a free StepZen account, let's log in here.\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1\n\nOn a browser window open the <a href=\"http://www.stepzen.com\" target=\"_blank\">URL below</a> (1) and click on **Log In** link (2).\n\n```\n http://www.stepzen.com\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/setup-sz-2.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.1.2\n\n**Log in** with your *username* and *password*.\n\n\n  ![](images/setup-sz-3.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>1.2 - Get your Account details</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nWhen we get our account, first we need to navigate to the Stepzen Dashboard. In the Account page, we will find our account name, and the two keys weneed for API authentication.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1\n\nOn StepZen Dashboard page, on the left menu, open the **Account** page (key icon).\n\n  ![](images/setup-sz-5.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.2.2\n\nCopy the **Account name** (1) and **Admin Key** (2). You will use them in the next step.\n\n  ![](images/setup-sz-6.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>1.3 - StepZen CLI log in</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nTo run StepZen in the cloud, we can connect the CLI to our account to get a private and secure endpoint or use StepZen with a public account. After installing the CLI, we can connect it to our account using the login CLI command.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.3.1\n\nUsing Visual Studio Code terminal window, execute the command below to log in with StepZen CLI, replace [your_account] with the account value (1) from the Account page.\n\n```\nstepzen login -a [your_account]\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/setup-sz-7.png)\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.3.2\n\nNow, you need to enter your Admin Key. Copy and paste the **Admin Key** value (2) from the Account page.\n\n  ![](images/setup-sz-8.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n### **2 - Build your GraphQL API from a REST API**\n\n<details>\n<summary>2.1 - Create your API directory</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nUsing StepZen, we can create a GraphQL API for backends with REST interfaces in minutes.\n\nThere are two ways to create our GraphQL API with StepZen when we have a REST backend.\n\n<ul>\n<li>Use the command-line interface (CLI) command stepzen import curl to specify an existing REST endpoint - StepZen introspects the endpoint and auto-generates a GraphQL schema for you.</li>\n<li>Write your schema code in a .graphql GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) file. Use the powerful GraphQL directive @rest to connect the REST endpoint, and with just a few lines of code, you have a working schema.</li>\n</ul><br/>\n\nIn this section we will learn how to use StepZen import curl on an existing REST API. This command sends a curl request to StepZen and parses the GraphQL types from the JSON response.\n\nBefore we build our GraphQL API, let’s create a new directory.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1\n\nOn Visual Studio Code Terminal, execute the command below to create a new directory.\n\n```\nmkdir product-demo\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/build-rest1-1.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2\n\nChange to the new directory.\n\n```\ncd product-demo\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n![](images/build-rest1-2.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>2.2 - Initialize the StepZen workspace</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nWe need to initialize the StepZen workspace in our working directory. Let's use the StepZen CLI init command to do it.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.2.1\n\nOn Visual Studio Code Terminal, execute the command below.\n\n```\nstepzen init --endpoint=api/product-demo\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/build-rest1-3.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>2.3 - Introspects the REST endpoint</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nLet's take advantage of StepZen to introspects the REST endpoint and auto-generates a GraphQL schema for us. Here we are using a REST API developed by our company's DEV team with CUSTOMERS information.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.3.1\n\nOn Visual Studio Code Terminal, execute the command below.\n\n```\nstepzen import curl \"https://introspection.apis.stepzen.com/customers\" --query-name \"customers\"\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/build-rest1-4.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n### **3 - Adding a new REST API in your GraphQL API**\n<details>\n<summary>3.1 - Import a new REST API</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nNow, let's improve our GraphQL API by addding another REST API. We just need to execute the import command again with a new REST URL to add a new REST API.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1\n\nOn Visual Studio Code Terminal, execute the command below to import another REST API.\n\n```\nstepzen import curl \"https://introspection.apis.stepzen.com/orders\" --query-name \"orders\" --query-type \"Order\"\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/build-rest2-1.png)\n\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>3.2 - Explore the schema</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nTo check the new graphQL schema, we just need to open the curl-01 folder and open the new index.graphql file. Here we can see the schema of the orders API.\n\nThis third schema in the product-demo folder is aggregating the other two schemas of our two different REST APIs.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.2.1\n\nOpen the **curl-01** folder and open the new **index.graphql** file (1). You are welcome to explore the new schema (2).\n\n  ![](images/build-rest2-2.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.2.2\n\nOpen the third schema, the **index.graphql** file in the **product-demo** folder (1) and check this schema is referencing the other two schemas (2).\n\n  ![](images/build-rest2-3.png)\n\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>3.3 - Start the endpoint</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nStepZen can be deployed and run as a managed service on StepZen's cloud, on a virtual private cloud, or in a colocation data center. Whatever your choice of deployment, StepZen helps you build clean, declarative, consistent APIs and run them at scale with built-in optimizations.\n\nTo Deploy and run our endpoint, from command line, let's run stepzen start command.\n\nThis command does three things:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Deploys the code in the current directory (or the directory provided via the --dir flag) to the specified endpoint on StepZen.</li>\n  <li>Watches the directory for changes and automatically deploys them to the endpoint specified.</li>\n  <li>Share a URL with StepZen's Schema Explorer that enables you to test your API by exploring the queries and types available and querying the API running on StepZen.</li>\n</ul><br/>\n\nThe StepZen dashboard provides a playground for testing your GraphQL API. Let's open it to explore our GraphQL API.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.3.1\n\nOn Visual Studio Code terminal,  run the command below to initialize your endpoint.\n\n```\nstepzen start\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/build-rest2-4.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.3.2\n\nShow the stepzen start return.\n  ![](images/build-rest2-4-2.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.3.3\n\nScroll down your terminal page to see the Dashboard URL of your API. Copy and paste it in you browser window.\n  ![](images/build-rest2-5.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>3.4 - Test the endpoint</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\nThe StepZen dashboard provides a playground for testing your GraphQL API. In the Dashboard we can play with different queries, for example, let's try the orders query.<br/><br/>Let's try a customers query now, with some fields. Remember, with this GraphQL API, we are consuming data from two different REST APIs. And we can do that with APIs from different types of data sources as well.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.4.1\n\nGo ahead and click **Execute Query** button (1) to test the orders query.  Check the result data (2).\n\n  ![](images/build-rest2-6.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.4.2\n\nYou are welcome to play with the Builder section (1), to create queries with different values. For example, delete the order query, and create a customers query with some fields (2). Execute the query again (3) and check the result data (4).\n\n  ![](images/build-rest2-7.png)\n\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n### **4 - Autogenerate GraphQL Schemas from MySQL Database**\n<details>\n<summary>4.1 - Import MySQL schema</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nNow, let's see how to create a GraphQL API with a SQL database backend.\n\nThere are two ways to create your GraphQL API with StepZen when you have a SQL database backend.\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Use the command-line interface (CLI) command stepzen import [mysql OR postgresql] to specify your database - StepZen introspects it and auto-generates a GraphQL schema for you.</li>\n  <li>Write your schema code in a .graphql GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) file. Use the GraphQL directive @dbquery to connect the database, and with just a few lines of code, you have a working schema.)</li>\n</ul><br/>\n\nHere, we will see how to use stepzen import mysql command. Our company database's team provided use with a MySQL database. Let's use StepZen CLI command to import it.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1\n\nOn Visual Studio Code terminal, cancel the current execution (CTRL+C). And execute the command below to create a GraphQL API that connects data from a database backend.\n\n```\nstepzen import mysql --db-host='db.introspection.stepzen.net' --db-database='introspection' --db-user='testUserIntrospection' --db-password='HurricaneStartingSample1934' --name=mysql\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/build-mysql-1.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>4.2 - Explore MySQL schema</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nTo check the new graphQL schema, open the mysql folder and open the new index.graphql file. Here we have our database schema from MySQL.\n\nBy now, we are invoking two REST APIs and one MySQL database in our GraphQL API.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 4.2.1\n\nOn VSCode, open the **mysql** folder and open the new **index.graphql** file (1). You are welcome to explore the new schema (2).\n\n  ![](images/build-mysql-2.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n### **5 - Creating a composition of building blocks using @materializer**\n<details>\n<summary>5.1 - Create the getAddressById query</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nIn many organizations, APIs are built around organizations or domains. For example, a B2C retail business might have customer APIs, e-commerce APIs, marketing APIs, and so on. These APIs are typically built by semi-independent teams, and usually have some common lightweight structures (like authentication, documentation, etc.), but otherwise are constructed independently. And they might appear in the same portal for the API consumer, but there is nothing that connects them.\n\nBecause GraphQL APIs are designed to “stitch” data together, GraphQL represents an opportunity to connect APIs easily—even those built by independent teams.  GraphQL federation is a critical element of your GraphQL architecture. Federation is about assembling the work of independent teams into one, or possibly a few, uber GraphQL APIs. Let's see how to do it!\n\nFirst, let's create a query to getAddressById in our MySQL database.\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.1.1\n\nOn the **index.graphql** from **mysql** folder (1), scroll down to see the ‘*type Query*’ declaration. Below the sentence \"**Queries for type ‘Address’**\" include the query code below (2).\n\n```\ngetAddressById(id: Int!): [Address]\n@dbquery(\n  type: \"mysql\"\n  query: \"\"\"\n  SELECT * FROM `address` where `id` = ?\n  \"\"\"\n  configuration: \"mysql_config\"\n)\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThis code is defining a getAddressById query to select address from mySQL database.\n\n  ![](images/merge-blocks-1.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.1.2\n\n**Save** the file (File > Save or CTRL+S).\n<br/>\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>5.2 - Create a composition with @materializer</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nBy now we have multiple subgraphs, we can link types across subgraphs with @materializer. Let's do it!\n\nWe just need to change our address field to use the getAdressById query that we have just created. We can easily link these two subgraphs with @materializer.\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.2.1\n\nOpen the **index.graphql** file from **curl** folder (1), this is the schema from customers REST API.  Scroll down to see the ‘*type RootEntry*’ section.  By now, the address is coming from the REST API endpoint. Let's change it to get this value from MySQL database. Replace the current address type definition (address: Address) for the code below (2).\n```\naddress: [Address]\n  @materializer (query: \"getAddressById\")\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/merge-blocks-2.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.2.2\n\n**Save** the file (File > Save or CTRL+S).\n<br/>\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>5.3 - Test the composition</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nWe are ready to deploy our new API. Now we can test the new API, by creating a customers query including address attributes.\n\nHere we have the result, including data from REST API and MySQL database at the same time.\n\nBefore we move to API Connections part, to see how to manage, secure and socialize this API, we need to take a copy of our API endpoint and the Authorization header. We will need them later to invoke our API.\n\nOne important point to highlight here is about how StepZen controls access to GraphQL schemas and endpoints.\n\nAs we build out our GraphQL APIs, we will want to add access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized use of these endpoints. StepZen supports two different solutions for this problem.\n\n<ul>\n  <li>API Keys: we can use API keys to control access to the entire endpoint. API keys are the default access control mechanism.</li>\n  <li>And Field Policies: we can use Field policies to control access to specific entry point fields on the endpoint. Field policies provide fine-grained access control to your GraphQL API, using a model similar to attribute-based access control.</li>\n</ul><br/>\n\nStepZen provides two different types of API keys for use with an account: Admin Keys and API Keys. Admin keys provide administrative-level access to your account, and should only be used at development time. API keys provide more limited access to your account, and should be used for production.\n\nIn this demo, for simplification purpose, we will use the Admin Keys to access our API. In a real environment, we should use API Keys or Field Policies to improve our API’s security.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.3.1\n\nOn Visual Studio Code terminal, execute the command below.\n```\nstepzen start\n```\n\n  ![](images/merge-blocks-3.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.3.2\n\nBack to the browser, refresh the Stepzen Dashboard page.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.3.3\n\nOn the StepZen Dashboard page, use the Builder section (1), to create a customers query including address attributes (2). Execute the query again (3) and check the result data is coming from Rest and MySQL database (4).\n\n  ![](images/merge-blocks-4.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.3.4\n\nTake a copy of your API endpoint (1) and the Authorization header (2).\n\n  ![](images/merge-blocks-5.png)\n\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n### **6 - Create a GraphQL Proxy API in APIC**\n<details>\n<summary>6.1 - Access your APIC Environment</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nGreat, our GraphQL API was created. However our developer's team still need a comprehensive API solution and strategy to manage these new GraphQL APIs from a unified and centrally visible solution. <br/><br/>They are looking for an integrated API management offering, with capabilities and tooling for all phases of the API lifecycle. Key steps of the API lifecycle include create, secure, manage, socialize, and analyze the APIs.\n\nIBM API Connect is a full lifecycle API management solution that uses an intuitive experience to help consistently create, manage, secure, socialize and monetize APIs, which promotes digital transformation on premises and across clouds. This means we can power digital apps and spur innovation in real-time. IBM API Connect is also available as-a-Service as a highly scalable, fully managed API management platform on Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nLet's explore how IBM API Connect will support our development team to manage our GraphQL APIs.  For this demo, we are using a trial account of IBM APIC on AWS.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.1.1\n\nIn your email inbox (that you used to create the APIC trial account), search for **IBM SaaS** (1), open the \"**Your API Connect trial is ready**\" email (2).\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-1.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.1.2\n\nNow, click **Access trial** button.\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-2.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.1.3\n\nLog in with your APIC user and password.\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-3.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>6.2 - Create a new API from existing GraphQL service</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nHere, you are on your API Connect Enterprise as a Service environment. API Connect Enterprise as a Service is a cloud-based edition of IBM API Connect. Using API Connect Enterprise as a Service enables you to work in the cloud to create, manage, secure, and socialize APIs using our latest user experiences, innovation, and industry standards for full API lifecycle management.\n\nAPI Connect Enterprise as a Service uses software-as-a-service as a delivery model. With this model, API Connect is hosted on Amazon Web Services and is managed by IBM. You pay for using the software without worrying about owning and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. With API Connect Enterprise as a Service, you pay for usage through your AWS bill.\n\nIBM API Connect enables you to create a GraphQL API proxy definition that proxies a backend GraphQL server. API Connect extends the GraphQL standard by providing, in a GraphQL API definition, the ability to configure a range of settings that are used to calculate the complexity of a GraphQL request and an associated cost that counts towards the rate limit.\n\nLet’s see how to create a GraphQL Proxy API.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.2.1\n\nClick on the **Develop** menu.\n\n  ![](images/apic-home.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.2.2\n\nThen click **Add->API**.\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-5.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.2.3\n\nSelect **From Existing GraphQL service (GraphQL proxy)** (1).  Then click **Next** (2).\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-6.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>6.3 - Add the details of your GraphQL service</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nNow, we need to add details from our GraphQL API created with API Connect Essentials (StepZen).  When we point to an existing GraphQL server, API Connect introspects the service and automatically creates a GraphQL proxy service.\n\nAs described earlier in this lab, your StepZen API is using an API Key approach to control access to the entire endpoint. Because of that, you need to include the API Key in the Authorization Header of the HTTP Header. Here you will include that to read the API Schema for introspection to setup this proxy API, and it will be used this one time only and not be saved for later to call the API itself. Let’s do it!\n\nThe schema validator reports warning and errors if found. Let's ignore the schema warning by now, will fix this warning in later steps.\n\nGreat! API Connect successfully created a GraphQL proxy API.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.3.1\n\nEnter the following values:\n\n  Title: **customers** (1)\n\n  GraphQL server URL: [*Your API URL copied from StepZen Dashboard*] (for example: https://wanaka.stepzen.net/api/product-demo/__graphql) (2)\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-7.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.3.2\n\nIn the *HTTP Header* section, click **Add** (1) to enter **Authorization** (2) as *Header* and paste the *API Key value* that you copied from the *StepZen Dashboard Headers* section as *Value* (3). Then click *Next* (4).\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-8.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.3.3\n\nIn the Paths section, select **all** the available endpoints (1), then click **Next** (2).\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-9.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.3.4\n\nKeep both **Secure using Client ID** and **CORS** checked (1) and click **Next** (2).\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-10.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.3.5\n\nGreat! API Connect successfully created a GraphQL proxy API.\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-11.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n### **7 - Editing and Testing the GraphQL Proxy API**\n<details>\n<summary>7.1 - Edit API</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\nNow, let’s edit the API to view more details on the proxy API just created.\n\nGraphQL APIs are structured the same as REST APIs with some additional options. Just like REST APIs, we will be able to add security schemas, paths and definitions from the left menu bar. We can also view the Gateway, Test and Explorer tabs similar to REST APIs. We will notice a new tab for GraphQL APIs. Let's explore the GraphQL Schema view.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.1.1\n\nClick **Edit API** to continue.\n\n  ![](images/apic-edit-1.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.1.2\n\nClick on **GraphQL Schema** tab to view the schema.\n\n  ![](images/apic-edit-2.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>7.2 - Apply suggestions</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nThe GraphQL Schema tab displays Type for every type in your GraphQL schema, and Type Weight information for the cost or expense of each type. The weighting factor is used when calculating the type cost for a request to the GraphQL API. For example, a field that requires extensive CPU or memory use on the server to retrieve its value would be given a higher cost.\n\nIn addition to the warning details, the Warning window gives an option to fix the warning by applying the limits. While this Artificial Intelligence is often very accurate, for a real scenario it is important to carefully examine the results and only accept them when they are accurate, since this affects the security of your application.\n\nAfter applying the recommendations, the warning message is removed.\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.2.1\n\nClick **View** in the *Warning* message.\n\n  ![](images/apic-edit-3.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.2.2\n\nIn our case, click **Apply all** (1), then click **Apply** (2).\n\n  ![](images/apic-edit-4.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.2.3\n\nClick **Save** to save the API definition.\n\n![](images/apic-edit-5.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>7.3 - Edit Gateway Flow</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nIt is time to explore the Gateway view.\n\nThe flow is automatically created as part of the initial API creation. You may apply additional logic by dragging and dropping items from the palette to the canvas. Let’s do a small change to allow Authorization header propagation.\n\nHere we can add Authorization header in the allowlist.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.3.1\n\nOpen the **Gateway** view.\n\n  ![](images/apic-edit-6.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.3.2\n\nScroll down the flow (1) and on the **Otherwise** ramification (2), you should see a **graphql-invoke** node, click on it to edit (3).\n\n  ![](images/apic-edit-7.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.3.3\n\nOn the *graphql-invoke* node definition, scroll down to see the *Header control* section.

To publish the API, first we need to set our API to online.\n\nAfter successfully publishing the API to API Gateway, additional tabs appear on the screen. Let's explore the Test tab.\n\nThe Test feature also includes a GraphQL Editor. Here we can include our customers query. We can use Prettify option to improve the visualization of the GraphQL query.\n\nNow we need to include the Authorization heard in the Parameters tab.\n\nEverytime that we invoke our API we need to pass your API Key as the Authorization header. So let’s include it in our test.\n\nOn the Trace section, we should see an HTTP Status: 200 and in the Response data we have the data returned from your GraphQL API.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.4.1\n\nToggle the button from offline to **online**.\n\n![](images/apic-edit-10.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.4.2\n\nSelect **Test** tab to test the API.\n\n![](images/apic-edit-11.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.4.3\n\nEnter the following GraphQL query in the GraphQL Editor.

Products are packages that contain both the APIs and the accompanying plans. The providers use plans to control access to APIs and to manage API usage. Plans can use differing rate limits to provide different levels of service to API consumers. We can have multiple plans for different consumers. For example, we can add approval steps for consumers when they sign up, or we can allocate them plans as a provider.\n\nLet's see how to create a product from scratch. After include the basic information about the product we can define the default plan.\n\nThe Default Plan contains traditional rate limiting options, but in the next steps, you will be able to list GraphQL Rate Limits.\n\nHere we publish the product to Sandbox catalog and aceppt the default for Visibility and Subscribability.\n\nGreat!

APIs serve as the essential connector between different data sources and applications, which means that businesses are relying on and creating more APIs than ever before to get the data they need to power their applications and experiences.\n<br/><br/>\nGraphQL has rapidly become a go-to query language for companies to interact with their data and is emerging as a new standard for APIs, layering upon the investments in REST APIs and data systems. While GraphQL APIs are significantly easier for the application teams to consume, they can represent a challenge to the API Provider teams tasked with building them.  We believe that APIs built declaratively are simply better - leading to first implementation with fewer lines of clean code, faster time to deploy, and APIs with built-in performance, cost, and reliability optimizations.\n<br/><br/>\nOur company decided to invest in GraphQL as a new standard for APIs. GraphQL is a query language for APIs that gives an application client greater control over what data it retrieves in an API request when compared with a REST API request.\n<br/><br/>\nWe would like to explore an easier way for developers to build GraphQL APIs, consuming data stored everywhere. Take an e-commerce application for example. With a single call, GraphQL can merge data that is found in different subsystems, like customer information, order numbers, and delivery status, and return it in an expected format. While GraphQL APIs are significantly easier for the application teams to consume, they can represent a challenge to the API teams tasked with building them, securing them, socializing them, and managing them. To ease the process of building these APIs, we would like to explore a way to create GraphQL APIs using a declarative approach for federated access to data.\n<br/><br/>\nOn the other hand, our Development's team is having problems managing the use of GraphQL APIs in your company, including rate limits, API lifecycle, security and how to socialize these APIs with our developers ecosystem.\n<br/><br/>\nIn this demo we will learn how to move from Zero to Enterprise in the GraphQL domain. Initially we will learn how to use API Connect Essentials (StepZen) to create a a federated GraphQL API by pulling data from disparate sources (REST API and MySQL). After that you will use IBM API Connect to create a GraphQL API proxy definition that proxies a backend GraphQL server from StepZen, and to define rate limiting controls that reflect the amount of data that is returned from the server by a request to the GraphQL API.\n<br/><br/>\nHere we will see how to CREATE, MANAGE, SECURE and SOCIALIZE our GraphQL APIs using IBM API Connect solutions.\n<br/><br/>\nLet's get started!<br/><br/>\n\n(Demo Slides <a href=\"https://github.com/ibm-integration/learninghub/blob/main/src/pages/demos/mq-techsales/files/APICSlides.pptx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>)\n<br/>\n\n\n### **1 - Setup StepZen**\n\n<details>\n<summary>1.1 - Access StepZen</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nStepZen enables developers to easily build, and deploy a single GraphQL API that gets the data they need from multiple backends. The StepZen CLI is the primary tool for creating, uploading, deploying and testing your StepZen API. The StepZen CLI enables you to manage your StepZen schemas, configurations, and endpoints. The CLI also comes with a built-in Schema Explorer that enables you to explore and test the API you’ve deployed locally from your browser.\n\n\nWe already installed StepZen CLI here. Now we need to get the details about our StepZen account. For this demo we are using a free StepZen account, let's log in here.\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1\n\nOn a browser window open the <a href=\"http://www.stepzen.com\" target=\"_blank\">URL below</a> (1) and click on **Log In** link (2).\n\n```\n http://www.stepzen.com\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/setup-sz-2.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.1.2\n\n**Log in** with your *username* and *password*.\n\n\n  ![](images/setup-sz-3.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>1.2 - Get your Account details</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nWhen we get our account, first we need to navigate to the Stepzen Dashboard. In the Account page, we will find our account name, and the two keys weneed for API authentication.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1\n\nOn StepZen Dashboard page, on the left menu, open the **Account** page (key icon).\n\n  ![](images/setup-sz-5.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.2.2\n\nCopy the **Account name** (1) and **Admin Key** (2). You will use them in the next step.\n\n  ![](images/setup-sz-6.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>1.3 - StepZen CLI log in</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nTo run StepZen in the cloud, we can connect the CLI to our account to get a private and secure endpoint or use StepZen with a public account. After installing the CLI, we can connect it to our account using the login CLI command.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.3.1\n\nUsing Visual Studio Code terminal window, execute the command below to log in with StepZen CLI, replace [your_account] with the account value (1) from the Account page.\n\n```\nstepzen login -a [your_account]\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/setup-sz-7.png)\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.3.2\n\nNow, you need to enter your Admin Key.

Use the powerful GraphQL directive @rest to connect the REST endpoint, and with just a few lines of code, you have a working schema.</li>\n</ul><br/>\n\nIn this section we will learn how to use StepZen import curl on an existing REST API. This command sends a curl request to StepZen and parses the GraphQL types from the JSON response.\n\nBefore we build our GraphQL API, let’s create a new directory.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1\n\nOn Visual Studio Code Terminal, execute the command below to create a new directory.\n\n```\nmkdir product-demo\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/build-rest1-1.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2\n\nChange to the new directory.\n\n```\ncd product-demo\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n![](images/build-rest1-2.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>2.2 - Initialize the StepZen workspace</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nWe need to initialize the StepZen workspace in our working directory. Let's use the StepZen CLI init command to do it.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.2.1\n\nOn Visual Studio Code Terminal, execute the command below.\n\n```\nstepzen init --endpoint=api/product-demo\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/build-rest1-3.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>2.3 - Introspects the REST endpoint</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nLet's take advantage of StepZen to introspects the REST endpoint and auto-generates a GraphQL schema for us. Here we are using a REST API developed by our company's DEV team with CUSTOMERS information.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.3.1\n\nOn Visual Studio Code Terminal, execute the command below.\n\n```\nstepzen import curl \"https://introspection.apis.stepzen.com/customers\" --query-name \"customers\"\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/build-rest1-4.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n### **3 - Adding a new REST API in your GraphQL API**\n<details>\n<summary>3.1 - Import a new REST API</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nNow, let's improve our GraphQL API by addding another REST API. We just need to execute the import command again with a new REST URL to add a new REST API.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1\n\nOn Visual Studio Code Terminal, execute the command below to import another REST API.\n\n```\nstepzen import curl \"https://introspection.apis.stepzen.com/orders\" --query-name \"orders\" --query-type \"Order\"\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/build-rest2-1.png)\n\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>3.2 - Explore the schema</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nTo check the new graphQL schema, we just need to open the curl-01 folder and open the new index.graphql file. Here we can see the schema of the orders API.\n\nThis third schema in the product-demo folder is aggregating the other two schemas of our two different REST APIs.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.2.1\n\nOpen the **curl-01** folder and open the new **index.graphql** file (1). You are welcome to explore the new schema (2).\n\n  ![](images/build-rest2-2.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.2.2\n\nOpen the third schema, the **index.graphql** file in the **product-demo** folder (1) and check this schema is referencing the other two schemas (2).\n\n  ![](images/build-rest2-3.png)\n\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>3.3 - Start the endpoint</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nStepZen can be deployed and run as a managed service on StepZen's cloud, on a virtual private cloud, or in a colocation data center. Whatever your choice of deployment, StepZen helps you build clean, declarative, consistent APIs and run them at scale with built-in optimizations.\n\nTo Deploy and run our endpoint, from command line, let's run stepzen start command.\n\nThis command does three things:\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Deploys the code in the current directory (or the directory provided via the --dir flag) to the specified endpoint on StepZen.</li>\n  <li>Watches the directory for changes and automatically deploys them to the endpoint specified.</li>\n  <li>Share a URL with StepZen's Schema Explorer that enables you to test your API by exploring the queries and types available and querying the API running on StepZen.</li>\n</ul><br/>\n\nThe StepZen dashboard provides a playground for testing your GraphQL API. Let's open it to explore our GraphQL API.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.3.1\n\nOn Visual Studio Code terminal,  run the command below to initialize your endpoint.\n\n```\nstepzen start\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/build-rest2-4.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.3.2\n\nShow the stepzen start return.\n  ![](images/build-rest2-4-2.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.3.3\n\nScroll down your terminal page to see the Dashboard URL of your API.

In the Dashboard we can play with different queries, for example, let's try the orders query.<br/><br/>Let's try a customers query now, with some fields. Remember, with this GraphQL API, we are consuming data from two different REST APIs. And we can do that with APIs from different types of data sources as well.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.4.1\n\nGo ahead and click **Execute Query** button (1) to test the orders query.  Check the result data (2).\n\n  ![](images/build-rest2-6.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.4.2\n\nYou are welcome to play with the Builder section (1), to create queries with different values. For example, delete the order query, and create a customers query with some fields (2). Execute the query again (3) and check the result data (4).\n\n  ![](images/build-rest2-7.png)\n\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n### **4 - Autogenerate GraphQL Schemas from MySQL Database**\n<details>\n<summary>4.1 - Import MySQL schema</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nNow, let's see how to create a GraphQL API with a SQL database backend.\n\nThere are two ways to create your GraphQL API with StepZen when you have a SQL database backend.\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Use the command-line interface (CLI) command stepzen import [mysql OR postgresql] to specify your database - StepZen introspects it and auto-generates a GraphQL schema for you.</li>\n  <li>Write your schema code in a .graphql GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) file. Use the GraphQL directive @dbquery to connect the database, and with just a few lines of code, you have a working schema.)</li>\n</ul><br/>\n\nHere, we will see how to use stepzen import mysql command. Our company database's team provided use with a MySQL database. Let's use StepZen CLI command to import it.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1\n\nOn Visual Studio Code terminal, cancel the current execution (CTRL+C). And execute the command below to create a GraphQL API that connects data from a database backend.\n\n```\nstepzen import mysql --db-host='db.introspection.stepzen.net' --db-database='introspection' --db-user='testUserIntrospection' --db-password='HurricaneStartingSample1934' --name=mysql\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/build-mysql-1.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>4.2 - Explore MySQL schema</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nTo check the new graphQL schema, open the mysql folder and open the new index.graphql file. Here we have our database schema from MySQL.\n\nBy now, we are invoking two REST APIs and one MySQL database in our GraphQL API.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 4.2.1\n\nOn VSCode, open the **mysql** folder and open the new **index.graphql** file (1). You are welcome to explore the new schema (2).\n\n  ![](images/build-mysql-2.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n### **5 - Creating a composition of building blocks using @materializer**\n<details>\n<summary>5.1 - Create the getAddressById query</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nIn many organizations, APIs are built around organizations or domains. For example, a B2C retail business might have customer APIs, e-commerce APIs, marketing APIs, and so on. These APIs are typically built by semi-independent teams, and usually have some common lightweight structures (like authentication, documentation, etc.), but otherwise are constructed independently. And they might appear in the same portal for the API consumer, but there is nothing that connects them.\n\nBecause GraphQL APIs are designed to “stitch” data together, GraphQL represents an opportunity to connect APIs easily—even those built by independent teams.  GraphQL federation is a critical element of your GraphQL architecture. Federation is about assembling the work of independent teams into one, or possibly a few, uber GraphQL APIs. Let's see how to do it!\n\nFirst, let's create a query to getAddressById in our MySQL database.\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.1.1\n\nOn the **index.graphql** from **mysql** folder (1), scroll down to see the ‘*type Query*’ declaration. Below the sentence \"**Queries for type ‘Address’**\" include the query code below (2).\n\n```\ngetAddressById(id: Int!): [Address]\n@dbquery(\n  type: \"mysql\"\n  query: \"\"\"\n  SELECT * FROM `address` where `id` = ?\n  \"\"\"\n  configuration: \"mysql_config\"\n)\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThis code is defining a getAddressById query to select address from mySQL database.\n\n  ![](images/merge-blocks-1.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.1.2\n\n**Save** the file (File > Save or CTRL+S).\n<br/>\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>5.2 - Create a composition with @materializer</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nBy now we have multiple subgraphs, we can link types across subgraphs with @materializer. Let's do it!\n\nWe just need to change our address field to use the getAdressById query that we have just created. We can easily link these two subgraphs with @materializer.\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.2.1\n\nOpen the **index.graphql** file from **curl** folder (1), this is the schema from customers REST API.  Scroll down to see the ‘*type RootEntry*’ section.  By now, the address is coming from the REST API endpoint. Let's change it to get this value from MySQL database. Replace the current address type definition (address: Address) for the code below (2).\n```\naddress: [Address]\n  @materializer (query: \"getAddressById\")\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/merge-blocks-2.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.2.2\n\n**Save** the file (File > Save or CTRL+S).\n<br/>\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>5.3 - Test the composition</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nWe are ready to deploy our new API. Now we can test the new API, by creating a customers query including address attributes.\n\nHere we have the result, including data from REST API and MySQL database at the same time.\n\nBefore we move to API Connections part, to see how to manage, secure and socialize this API, we need to take a copy of our API endpoint and the Authorization header. We will need them later to invoke our API.\n\nOne important point to highlight here is about how StepZen controls access to GraphQL schemas and endpoints.\n\nAs we build out our GraphQL APIs, we will want to add access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized use of these endpoints. StepZen supports two different solutions for this problem.\n\n<ul>\n  <li>API Keys: we can use API keys to control access to the entire endpoint. API keys are the default access control mechanism.</li>\n  <li>And Field Policies: we can use Field policies to control access to specific entry point fields on the endpoint. Field policies provide fine-grained access control to your GraphQL API, using a model similar to attribute-based access control.</li>\n</ul><br/>\n\nStepZen provides two different types of API keys for use with an account: Admin Keys and API Keys. Admin keys provide administrative-level access to your account, and should only be used at development time. API keys provide more limited access to your account, and should be used for production.\n\nIn this demo, for simplification purpose, we will use the Admin Keys to access our API. In a real environment, we should use API Keys or Field Policies to improve our API’s security.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.3.1\n\nOn Visual Studio Code terminal, execute the command below.\n```\nstepzen start\n```\n\n  ![](images/merge-blocks-3.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.3.2\n\nBack to the browser, refresh the Stepzen Dashboard page.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.3.3\n\nOn the StepZen Dashboard page, use the Builder section (1), to create a customers query including address attributes (2). Execute the query again (3) and check the result data is coming from Rest and MySQL database (4).\n\n  ![](images/merge-blocks-4.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.3.4\n\nTake a copy of your API endpoint (1) and the Authorization header (2).\n\n  ![](images/merge-blocks-5.png)\n\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n### **6 - Create a GraphQL Proxy API in APIC**\n<details>\n<summary>6.1 - Access your APIC Environment</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nGreat, our GraphQL API was created. However our developer's team still need a comprehensive API solution and strategy to manage these new GraphQL APIs from a unified and centrally visible solution. <br/><br/>They are looking for an integrated API management offering, with capabilities and tooling for all phases of the API lifecycle. Key steps of the API lifecycle include create, secure, manage, socialize, and analyze the APIs.\n\nIBM API Connect is a full lifecycle API management solution that uses an intuitive experience to help consistently create, manage, secure, socialize and monetize APIs, which promotes digital transformation on premises and across clouds. This means we can power digital apps and spur innovation in real-time. IBM API Connect is also available as-a-Service as a highly scalable, fully managed API management platform on Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nLet's explore how IBM API Connect will support our development team to manage our GraphQL APIs.  For this demo, we are using a trial account of IBM APIC on AWS.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.1.1\n\nIn your email inbox (that you used to create the APIC trial account), search for **IBM SaaS** (1), open the \"**Your API Connect trial is ready**\" email (2).\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-1.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.1.2\n\nNow, click **Access trial** button.\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-2.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.1.3\n\nLog in with your APIC user and password.\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-3.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>6.2 - Create a new API from existing GraphQL service</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nHere, you are on your API Connect Enterprise as a Service environment. API Connect Enterprise as a Service is a cloud-based edition of IBM API Connect. Using API Connect Enterprise as a Service enables you to work in the cloud to create, manage, secure, and socialize APIs using our latest user experiences, innovation, and industry standards for full API lifecycle management.\n\nAPI Connect Enterprise as a Service uses software-as-a-service as a delivery model. With this model, API Connect is hosted on Amazon Web Services and is managed by IBM. You pay for using the software without worrying about owning and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. With API Connect Enterprise as a Service, you pay for usage through your AWS bill.\n\nIBM API Connect enables you to create a GraphQL API proxy definition that proxies a backend GraphQL server. API Connect extends the GraphQL standard by providing, in a GraphQL API definition, the ability to configure a range of settings that are used to calculate the complexity of a GraphQL request and an associated cost that counts towards the rate limit.\n\nLet’s see how to create a GraphQL Proxy API.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.2.1\n\nClick on the **Develop** menu.\n\n  ![](images/apic-home.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.2.2\n\nThen click **Add->API**.\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-5.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.2.3\n\nSelect **From Existing GraphQL service (GraphQL proxy)** (1).

When we point to an existing GraphQL server, API Connect introspects the service and automatically creates a GraphQL proxy service.\n\nAs described earlier in this lab, your StepZen API is using an API Key approach to control access to the entire endpoint. Because of that, you need to include the API Key in the Authorization Header of the HTTP Header. Here you will include that to read the API Schema for introspection to setup this proxy API, and it will be used this one time only and not be saved for later to call the API itself. Let’s do it!\n\nThe schema validator reports warning and errors if found. Let's ignore the schema warning by now, will fix this warning in later steps.\n\nGreat! API Connect successfully created a GraphQL proxy API.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.3.1\n\nEnter the following values:\n\n  Title: **customers** (1)\n\n  GraphQL server URL: [*Your API URL copied from StepZen Dashboard*] (for example: https://wanaka.stepzen.net/api/product-demo/__graphql) (2)\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-7.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.3.2\n\nIn the *HTTP Header* section, click **Add** (1) to enter **Authorization** (2) as *Header* and paste the *API Key value* that you copied from the *StepZen Dashboard Headers* section as *Value* (3). Then click *Next* (4).\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-8.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.3.3\n\nIn the Paths section, select **all** the available endpoints (1), then click **Next** (2).\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-9.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.3.4\n\nKeep both **Secure using Client ID** and **CORS** checked (1) and click **Next** (2).\n\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-10.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.3.5\n\nGreat!

Just like REST APIs, we will be able to add security schemas, paths and definitions from the left menu bar. We can also view the Gateway, Test and Explorer tabs similar to REST APIs. We will notice a new tab for GraphQL APIs. Let's explore the GraphQL Schema view.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.1.1\n\nClick **Edit API** to continue.\n\n  ![](images/apic-edit-1.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.1.2\n\nClick on **GraphQL Schema** tab to view the schema.\n\n  ![](images/apic-edit-2.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>7.2 - Apply suggestions</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nThe GraphQL Schema tab displays Type for every type in your GraphQL schema, and Type Weight information for the cost or expense of each type. The weighting factor is used when calculating the type cost for a request to the GraphQL API. For example, a field that requires extensive CPU or memory use on the server to retrieve its value would be given a higher cost.\n\nIn addition to the warning details, the Warning window gives an option to fix the warning by applying the limits. While this Artificial Intelligence is often very accurate, for a real scenario it is important to carefully examine the results and only accept them when they are accurate, since this affects the security of your application.\n\nAfter applying the recommendations, the warning message is removed.\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.2.1\n\nClick **View** in the *Warning* message.\n\n  ![](images/apic-edit-3.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.2.2\n\nIn our case, click **Apply all** (1), then click **Apply** (2).\n\n  ![](images/apic-edit-4.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.2.3\n\nClick **Save** to save the API definition.\n\n![](images/apic-edit-5.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>7.3 - Edit Gateway Flow</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nIt is time to explore the Gateway view.\n\nThe flow is automatically created as part of the initial API creation. You may apply additional logic by dragging and dropping items from the palette to the canvas. Let’s do a small change to allow Authorization header propagation.\n\nHere we can add Authorization header in the allowlist.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.3.1\n\nOpen the **Gateway** view.\n\n  ![](images/apic-edit-6.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.3.2\n\nScroll down the flow (1) and on the **Otherwise** ramification (2), you should see a **graphql-invoke** node, click on it to edit (3).\n\n  ![](images/apic-edit-7.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.3.3\n\nOn the *graphql-invoke* node definition, scroll down to see the *Header control* section. Click on **Add allowlist** to add a new header in the list.\n\n  ![](images/apic-edit-8.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.3.4\n\nEnter **Authorization** as the new header allowed (1) and click **Save** button (2). This means that we will send the Authorization header on to the backend.\n\n  ![](images/apic-edit-9.png)\n\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>7.4 - Test the API</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nNow, let's test the API. To publish the API, first we need to set our API to online.\n\nAfter successfully publishing the API to API Gateway, additional tabs appear on the screen. Let's explore the Test tab.\n\nThe Test feature also includes a GraphQL Editor. Here we can include our customers query. We can use Prettify option to improve the visualization of the GraphQL query.\n\nNow we need to include the Authorization heard in the Parameters tab.\n\nEverytime that we invoke our API we need to pass your API Key as the Authorization header. So let’s include it in our test.\n\nOn the Trace section, we should see an HTTP Status: 200 and in the Response data we have the data returned from your GraphQL API.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.4.1\n\nToggle the button from offline to **online**.\n\n![](images/apic-edit-10.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.4.2\n\nSelect **Test** tab to test the API.\n\n![](images/apic-edit-11.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.4.3\n\nEnter the following GraphQL query in the GraphQL Editor. You may use **Prettify** option to improve the visualization of the GraphQL query.\n\n```\n{\n  customers {\n    email\n    id\n    name\n    address {\n      city\n      countryRegion\n      postalCode\n      stateProvince\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n  ![](images/apic-edit-12.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.4.4\n\nNow you need to include the Authorization heard.

Let’s do it!\n\nNow, we will add a set variable node before the graphql-invoke. This node will add the authorization header in our message with the value that we copied from StepZen Dashboard.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.5.1\n\nOpen the **Gateway** tab again.\n\n  ![](images/apic-edit-17.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.5.2\n\nOn the **Otherwise** (1) which starts with a *Parse*, you will add a node before the *graphql-invoke* node.  On the *Palette* view, scroll down to see the *Policies* section (2).

Products are packages that contain both the APIs and the accompanying plans. The providers use plans to control access to APIs and to manage API usage. Plans can use differing rate limits to provide different levels of service to API consumers. We can have multiple plans for different consumers. For example, we can add approval steps for consumers when they sign up, or we can allocate them plans as a provider.\n\nLet's see how to create a product from scratch. After include the basic information about the product we can define the default plan.\n\nThe Default Plan contains traditional rate limiting options, but in the next steps, you will be able to list GraphQL Rate Limits.\n\nHere we publish the product to Sandbox catalog and aceppt the default for Visibility and Subscribability.\n\nGreat! We have our new product.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 8.1.1\n\nClick **Add->Product**.\n\n  ![](images/apic-product-1.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 8.1.2\n\nSelect **New product** (1) and click **Next** (2).\n\n  ![](images/apic-product-2.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 8.1.3\n\nName the product as **Customers Product** (1) and click **Next** (2).\n\n  ![](images/apic-product-3.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 8.1.4\n\nAdd Customers API to the product by selecting **customers** (1).

We can set a limit or make it unlimited. In this demo, we will not be making any changes.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 8.2.1\n\nBack to the *Develop* view, open **Products** tab (1) and click on **Customers Product** (2).\n\n  ![](images/apic-product-8.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 8.2.2\n\nOpen the **Plans** section (1), and on the *Default Plan*, open the **context menu** (2) and select **Edit** (3).\n\n  ![](images/apic-product-9.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 8.2.3\n\nShow the GraphQL rate limits section.\n\n  ![](images/apic-product-10.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 8.2.4\n\nOn the left menu, click **Manage** icon to manage our Sandbox catalog.\n\n  ![](images/apic-product-11.png)\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n### **9 - Socialize your API**\n<details>\n<summary>9.1 - Access the Developer Portal</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\nNow that you’ve published your API, you need to make sure that your API consumers can discover it and use it. Your Developer Portal will allow customers to view the APIs, sign up and subscribe to plans in a self-service manner, test the APIs, download the OpenAPI - Swagger documents and more.\n\nFirst, we need to get our Portal URL.\n\nGreat, here we have our **Portal URL**. Let's open it in a new browser tab.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 9.1.1\n\nOn *Manage* page, open the **Sandbox** catalog.\n\n  ![](images/apic-portal-1.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 9.1.2\n\nClick **Catalog settings** (1) and open the **Portal** tab (2).\n\n  ![](images/apic-portal-2.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 9.1.3\n\nHere you have your **Portal URL**. Copy it, and open it in a new browser tab.\n\n  ![](images/apic-portal-3.png)\n\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>9.2 - Register a Developer Acccount</summary><br/>\n\n**Narration**\n\nThis Developer Portal is your public-facing website and therefore it is highly flexible and customizable, but we’ll be using the default design.\n\nNow, we need to create an account to simulate an API consumer. Let's do it!\n\nAfter validate the new account, we are ready to log in!\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 9.2.1\n\nClick **Create account** to create a new developer account.\n\n  ![](images/apic-portal-4.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 9.2.2\n\nComplete the registration form, go ahead and use any personal email.  Take note of the username (not email) and password. You will need them later to log in to the Developer Portal.\n\n  ![](images/apic-portal-5.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 9.2.3\n\nYou will receive an email to activate your new developer account.

In our case, no Apps created yet. As a consumer/developer, we’re going to create a new application in the portal. This will give us an API key, allowing us to call our APIs.\n\nWe have not subscribed to any APIs, so let’s do it now. Subscribe to Customers Product 1.0. Now that we selected our API product, we can see the plans available. In our case, Default plan. We want to subscribe to the plan, but which application do we want to use to subscribe? We can have many applications, but in this demo, we’ve only created one. So, we just need to select the app that we created earlier and confirm our subscription. And done - we are subscribed to our API!\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 9.3.1\n\nClick **Create a new App**.\n\n  ![](images/apic-portal-8.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 9.3.2\n\nEnter **Consumers Application** as the **App Title** (1).

Let’s explore our API here. From the Overview page, we can download the OpenAPI Document and get the API endpoint. Note the portal has everything you need to call your API, it’s even generated clients in various languages for you to copy/paste into your calling application. You can try the API on the Try it area. We can use our customers query here. Now, let’s test it. Great, we got a response, Our GraphQL Proxy API is running and available for your ecosystem. Check how quickly the results are returned in the results window, coming from different sources. If this was a REST API multiple end points would be needed to achieve the same result.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 9.4.1\n\nClick the **customers 1.0.0 API**.\n\n  ![](images/apic-portal-17.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 9.4.2\n\nOpen the **Try it** tab.\n\n  ![](images/apic-portal-18.png)\n\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 9.4.3\n\nPaste the API Key that you copied in the previous step (1). Paste the GraphQL below in the GraphQL editor (2). And click on **Execute Query** button (3).\n\n```\n{\n  customers {\n    email\n    id\n    name\n    address {\n      city\n      countryRegion\n      postalCode\n      stateProvince\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n  ![](images/apic-portal-19.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 9.4.4\n\nYour GraphQL Proxy API is running.

We just need to select our app, and here we can see all the API calls, including any possible errors. If you make more calls, you’ll see larger statistic results.\n\nIn this page, the developers can view information and insights about the application.\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 9.5.1\n\nOpen the **Apps** page (1) and select the **Consumers Application** (2).\n\n  ![](images/apic-portal-21.png)\n\n<hr/><br/>\n\n**Action** &nbsp; 9.5.2\n\nShow the statistics page.\n\n  ![](images/apic-portal-22.png)\n\n\n***\n</details>\n\n<br/><br/>\n\n### **Summary**\n\n<br/>\nLet’s summarize what we’ve done today. In the demo we:<br/>\n<ul>\n<li>Created a GraphQL API using a declarative approach using API Connect Essentials (StepZen);</li>\n<li>Created a GraphQL API using different sources (two REST services and one MySQL database);</li>\n<li>Created a graph composition using @materializer;</li>\n<li>Deployed the new GraphQL API on StepZen Cloud runtime;</li>\n<li>Created a GraphQL Proxy API in API Connect to call the GraphQL API on StepZen;</li>\n<li>Managed our API and set up the security and rate limits;</li>\n<li>Create a Product and apply GraphQL RateLimits;</li>\n<li>Socialize our GraphQL API on Developer Portal and demonstrated how a developer can use the API portal to perform self-service consumption of the API;</li>\n</ul><br/>\nFrom a business perspective, we used APIs to automate a series of steps to: obtain customer and order information from different sources (legacy services and databases). We presented how API is the foundation of a digital transformation journey.\n<br/><br/>\nFor developers, we demonstrated an easier way to build GraphQL APIs, consuming data stored everywhere.  At the same time, we presented a complete API Management solution that enables them to create, secure, socialize and manage APIs.\n<br/><br/>\nThank you for attending today’s presentation.\n<br/>\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/rafaelosorio/Documents/GitHub/learninghub/src/pages/demos/apic-tech-graphql/demo-script-we.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","137577622","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","768070550"]}
