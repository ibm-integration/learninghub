APIs serve as the essential connector between different data sources and applications, which means that businesses are relying on and creating more APIs than ever before to get the data they need power their applications and experiences.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nGraphQL has rapidly become a go-to query language for companies to interact with their data and is emerging as a new standard for APIs, layering upon the investments in REST APIs and data systems. While GraphQL APIs are significantly easier for the application teams to consume, they can represent a challenge to the API Provider teams tasked with building them. We believe that APIs built declaratively are simply better leading to first implementation with fewer lines of clean code, faster time to deploy, and APIs with built-in performance, cost, and reliability optimizations.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFocus Corporation, a hypothetical retail company engaged with IBM, is highly motivated to derive more revenue from first-time customers to their online storefronts. The Focus development team decided to invest in GraphQL as a new standard for APIs. GraphQL is a query language for APIs that gives an application client greater control over what data it retrieves in an API request when compared with a REST API request.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFocus’ developers would like to explore an easier way for developers to build GraphQL APIs, consuming data stored everywhere.  While GraphQL APIs are significantly easier for the application teams to consume, they can represent a challenge to the API teams tasked with building them, securing them, socializing them, and managing them. To ease the process of building these APIs, they would like to explore a way to create GraphQL APIs using a declarative approach for federated access to data.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFocus’ team requested a demo to learn how to move from zero to enterprise in the GraphQL API domain. In the following demo, Focus’ developers will learn how to use API Connect Essentials (StepZen) to create a federated GraphQL API by pulling data from disparate sources (REST API and MySQL). After that they will use IBM API Connect to create a GraphQL API proxy definition that proxies a backend GraphQL server from API Connect Essentials and define rate limiting controls that reflect the amount of data that is returned from the server. In this demo, Focus will see how to CREATE, MANAGE, SECURE and SOCIALIZE their GraphQL APIs using the IBM API Connect solution.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n(Demo Slides <a href=\"https://github.com/ibm-integration/learninghub/blob/main/src/pages/demos/apic-tech-graphql/files/APICGraphQLSlides.pptx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>)\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n### **1 - Setup API Connect Essentials (StepZen)**\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>1.1 - Access APIC Essentials</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nAPI Connect Essentials enables developers to easily build and deploy a single GraphQL API that gets the data they need from multiple backends. The API Connect Essentials CLI is the primary tool for creating, uploading, deploying, and testing their GraphQL APIs. The CLI enables Focus’ developers to manage their API Connect Essentials schemas, configurations, and endpoints. The CLI also comes with a built-in Schema Explorer that enables them to explore and test the API.\r\n\r\nFocus' developers already installed the API Connect Essentials CLI. Next, they need to get the details about their account. For this demo, they are using a free StepZen account.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1\r\n\r\nIn your email inbox (that you used to create the API Connect Essentials free account), search for **IBM SaaS** (1), open the \"**Access your IBM API Connect Essentials free instance**\" email (2). Then click **Access Lite** (3).\r\n\r\n  ![](images/stepzen-new-access-1.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.1.2\r\n\r\nClick the **Log in** button.\r\n\r\n  ![](images/stepzen-new-access-2.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.1.3\r\n\r\n**Log in** with your *username* and *password*.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ![](images/stepzen-new-access-3.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>1.2 - Get your Account details</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nTo get the details about Focus’ account, first they need to navigate to the API Connect Essentials Dashboard. On this page, under the “Authentication details” twisty, they will find their environment name, the domain, and the two keys they need for API authentication.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1\r\n\r\nOn the API Connect Essentials Dashboard page, scroll down to see the *Authentication details* section. Copy the **Environment** name (1), the **Domain** (2) and **Admin Key** (3). You will use them in the next step.\r\n\r\n  ![](images/setup-new-sz-6.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>1.3 - APIC Essentials CLI log in</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nTo run APIC Essentials in the cloud, the developers can connect the CLI to their account to get a private and secure endpoint or use APIC Essentials with a public account. After installing the CLI, they are able to connect it to their account using the login CLI command.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.3.1\r\n\r\nUsing the Visual Studio Code terminal window, execute the command below to log in with API Connect Essentials CLI, replace [your_environment] with the environment value (1), and [your_domain] with the domain value (2) from the Account details page.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstepzen login [your_domain] -a [your_environment]\r\n```\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n  ![](images/setup-new-sz-7.png)\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.3.2\r\n\r\nNow, you need to enter your Admin Key. Copy and paste the **Admin Key** value (3) from the *Authentication details* section.\r\n\r\n  ![](images/setup-new-sz-8.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n### **2 - Build a GraphQL API from a REST API**\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>2.1 - Create your API directory</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nUsing API Connect Essentials, Focus’ developers can create a GraphQL API for backends with REST interfaces in minutes.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to create a GraphQL API with StepZen when they have a REST backend:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Use the command-line interface (CLI) command <i>stepzen import curl</i> to specify an existing REST endpoint - StepZen introspects the endpoint and auto-generates a GraphQL schema for you.</li>\r\n<li>Write the schema code in a <i>.graphql</i> GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) file. Use the powerful GraphQL directive <i>@rest</i> to connect the REST endpoint, and with just a few lines of code, they have a working schema.</li>\r\n</ul><br/>\r\n\r\nIn this module, Focus’ developers will learn how to use the <i>stepzen import curl</i> command on an existing REST API. This command sends a curl request to API Connect Essentials and parses the GraphQL types from the JSON response. Before the developers build their GraphQL API, they need to create a new directory.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1\r\n\r\nOn the Visual Studio Code Terminal, execute the command below to create a new directory.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir product-demo\r\n```\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n  ![](images/build-rest1-1.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2\r\n\r\nChange to the new directory.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd product-demo\r\n```\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n![](images/build-rest1-2.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>2.2 - Initialize the APIC Essentials workspace</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nWith the directory created, Focus’ developers need to initialize the API Connect Essentials workspace in their working directory. They use the CLI <i>init</i> command to do it.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.2.1\r\n\r\nOn the Visual Studio Code Terminal, execute the command below.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstepzen init --endpoint=api/product-demo\r\n```\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n  ![](images/build-rest1-3.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>2.3 - Introspects the REST endpoint</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nAn amazing feature of API Connect Essentials is the capability to introspect the REST endpoint and auto-generate a GraphQL schema for Focus’ team. Using this option, the Focus’ developers are using a REST API provided by their legacy CRM system with their CUSTOMERS information and creating a new GraphQL API.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.3.1\r\n\r\nOn the Visual Studio Code Terminal, execute the command below.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstepzen import curl \"https://introspection.apis.stepzen.com/customers\" --query-name \"customers\"\r\n```\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n  ![](images/build-rest1-4.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>2.4 - Explore GraphQL schema</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nTheir first GraphQL API was created. Now, it is time to explore the graphQL schema! First, they need to open their project folder and open the index.graphql file in the curl folder. Here, the developers have all the schema of their customers REST API.  Before, they deploy the GraphQL, they would like to import another REST endpoint.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.4.1\r\n\r\nIn Visual Studio Code, click on **Explorer** icon (1) and click **Open Folder** (2).\r\n\r\n  ![](images/build-rest1-5.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.4.2\r\n\r\nSelect the new created **product-demo** folder (1) and click **Select Folder** (2).\r\n\r\n  ![](images/build-rest1-6.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.4.3\r\n\r\nIf necessary, click **Yes, I trust the authors** button.\r\n\r\n  ![](images/build-rest1-7.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.4.4\r\n\r\nTo see the GraphQL schema, open the **curl** folder and select the **index.graphql** file (1).

To do it, they just need to run the import command again with a different REST URL.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1\r\n\r\nOn Visual Studio Code Terminal, execute the command below to import another REST API.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstepzen import curl \"https://introspection.apis.stepzen.com/orders\" --query-name \"orders\" --query-type \"Order\"\r\n```\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n  ![](images/build-rest2-1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>3.2 - Explore the schema</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nTo check the new graphQL schema, the developers just need to open the curl-01 folder and open the new index.graphql file. Here they can see the schema of the orders API.\r\n\r\nThis third schema in the product-demo folder is aggregating the other two schemas of the two different REST APIs.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.2.1\r\n\r\nOpen the **curl-01** folder and open the new **index.graphql** file (1). You are welcome to explore the new schema (2).\r\n\r\n  ![](images/build-rest2-2.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.2.2\r\n\r\nOpen the third schema, the **index.graphql** file in the **product-demo** folder (1) and check this schema is referencing the other two schemas (2).\r\n\r\n  ![](images/build-rest2-3.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>3.3 - Start the endpoint</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nAPI Connect Essentials can be deployed and run as a managed service on API Connect Essentials's cloud, on a virtual private cloud, or in an on premise data center. Whatever Focus’ choice of deployment, StepZen helps them to build clean, declarative, consistent APIs and run them at scale with built-in optimizations.\r\n\r\nTo Deploy and run their endpoint, from command line, the Focus’ developers will run the <i>stepzen start</i> command.\r\n\r\nThis command does three things:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>Deploys the code in the current directory (or the directory provided via the --dir flag) to the specified endpoint on StepZen.</li>\r\n  <li>Watches the directory for changes and automatically deploys them to the endpoint specified.</li>\r\n  <li>Shares a URL with StepZen's Schema Explorer that enables the developers to test their API by exploring the queries and types available and querying the API running on StepZen.</li>\r\n</ul><br/>\r\n\r\nThe API Connect Essentials dashboard provides a playground for testing Focus’ GraphQL API. Next, they will explore their GraphQL API.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.3.1\r\n\r\nOn the Visual Studio Code terminal,  run the command below to initialize your endpoint.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstepzen start\r\n```\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n  ![](images/build-rest2-4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.3.2\r\n\r\nShow the *stepzen start* command return.\r\n  ![](images/build-rest2-4-2.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.3.3\r\n\r\nBack to the APIC Essentials page, open the **Endpoint** page.\r\n  ![](images/build-new-rest2-5.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.3.4\r\n\r\nClick on **Actions** menu (1) and select **Open Explorer** (2).\r\n  ![](images/build-new-rest2-6.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>3.4 - Test the endpoint</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nThe APIC Essentials Explorer provides a playground for testing the GraphQL API. In the Explorer, Focus’ developers can play with different queries, for example they can try the orders query. Another possibility is to run a customer query, with some custom fields. Remember, with this GraphQL API, they are consuming data from two different REST APIs. If they want, they can do that with APIs from different types of data sources as well.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 3.4.1\r\n\r\nGo ahead and click **Execute Query** button (1) to test the *customers* query.

API Connect Essentials introspects it and auto-generates a GraphQL schema for you.</li>\r\n  <li>Write the schema code in a <i>.graphql</i> GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) file. Use the GraphQL directive <i>@dbquery</i> to connect the database, and with just a few lines of code, they have a working schema.</li>\r\n</ul><br/>\r\n\r\nFocus' team decided to use the <i>stepzen import mysql</i> command. Focus's Database team provided all the details of the MySQL database. The developers use the API Connect Essentials CLI command to import the database schema to a GraphQL API.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1\r\n\r\nOn the Visual Studio Code terminal, cancel the current execution (CTRL+C).

Here they have their database schema from MySQL.\r\n\r\nNow, they are invoking two REST APIs and one MySQL database query in their GraphQL API.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 4.2.1\r\n\r\nIn VSCode, open the **mysql** folder and open the new **index.graphql** file (1). You are welcome to explore the new schema (2).\r\n\r\n  ![](images/build-mysql-2.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n### **5 - Creating a composition of building blocks using @materializer**\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>5.1 - Create the getAddressById query</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nIn many organizations, APIs are built around organizations or domains. For example, a B2C retail business might have customer APIs, e-commerce APIs, marketing APIs, and so on. These APIs are typically built by semi-independent teams, and usually have some common lightweight structures (like authentication, documentation, etc.), but otherwise are constructed independently. And they might appear in the same portal for the API consumer, but there is nothing that connects them.\r\n\r\nBecause GraphQL APIs are designed to “stitch” data together, GraphQL represents an opportunity to Focus’ team to connect APIs easil even those built by independent teams.  GraphQL federation is a critical element of a GraphQL architecture. Federation is about assembling the work of independent teams into one, or possibly a few, uber GraphQL APIs. Focus’ developers would like to see how to do it!\r\n\r\nFirst, they need to create a query to getAddressById in their MySQL database.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.1.1\r\n\r\nOn the **index.graphql** from **mysql** folder (1), scroll down to see the ‘*type Query*’ declaration. Below the sentence \"**Queries for type ‘Address’**\", include the query code below (2).\r\n\r\n```\r\ngetAddressById(id: Int!): [Address]\r\n@dbquery(\r\n  type: \"mysql\"\r\n  query: \"\"\"\r\n  SELECT * FROM `address` where `id` = ?\r\n  \"\"\"\r\n  configuration: \"mysql_config\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis code is defining a getAddressById query to select the address from the MySQL database.\r\n\r\n  ![](images/merge-blocks-1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.1.2\r\n\r\n**Save** the file (File > Save or CTRL+S).\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>5.2 - Create a composition with @materializer</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nAt this stage, they have multiple subgraphs. They would like to explore the scenario of link types across subgraphs with <i>@materializer</i>.\r\n\r\nFocus’ team just needs to change the address field to use the getAddressById query that they have just created. With that, they can easily link these two subgraphs with <i>@materializer</i>.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.2.1\r\n\r\nOpen the **index.graphql** file from the **curl** folder (1), this is the schema from the customers REST API.  Scroll down to see the ‘*type RootEntry*’ section.  By now, the address is coming from the REST API endpoint. Let's change it to get this value from MySQL database. Replace the current address type definition (address: Address) for the code below (2).\r\n```\r\naddress: [Address]\r\n  @materializer (query: \"getAddressById\")\r\n```\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n  ![](images/merge-blocks-2.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.2.2\r\n\r\n**Save** the file (File > Save or CTRL+S).\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>5.3 - Test the composition</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nFocus’ developers are ready to deploy their new API. Now they can test the new API, by creating a customers query including address attributes.\r\n\r\nFinally, here is the response, including data from the REST API and the MySQL database at the same time.\r\n\r\nBefore the developers move to the API Connections part, to see how to manage, secure and socialize this API, they need to take a copy of their API endpoint and the Authorization header. They will use this information later to invoke this API.\r\n\r\nOne important point to highlight here is about how API Connect Essentials controls access to GraphQL schemas and endpoints.\r\n\r\nAs Focus’ team build out their GraphQL APIs, they will want to add access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized use of these endpoints. API Connect Essentials supports two different solutions for this problem.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>API Keys: they can use API keys to control access to the entire endpoint. API keys are the default access control mechanism.</li>\r\n  <li>Field Policies: they can use Field policies to control access to specific entry point fields on the endpoint. Field policies provide fine-grained access control to their GraphQL API, using a model similar to attribute-based access control.</li>\r\n</ul><br/>\r\n\r\nAPI Connect Essentials provides two different types of API keys for use with an account: Admin Keys and API Keys. Admin keys provide administrative-level access to their account and should only be used at development time. API keys provide more limited access to their account and should be used for production.\r\n\r\nIn this demo, for simplification purpose, Focus’ developers will use the Admin Keys to access their API. In a real environment, they should use API Keys or Field Policies to improve their API’s security.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.3.1\r\n\r\nOn the Visual Studio Code terminal, execute the command below.\r\n```\r\nstepzen start\r\n```\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n  ![](images/merge-blocks-3.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.3.2\r\n\r\nBack to the browser, refresh the API Connect Essentials Explorer page.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.3.3\r\n\r\nOn the APIC Essentials Explorer page, use the Builder section (1), to create a customers query including address attributes (2).

However, the developer's team still needs a comprehensive API solution and strategy to manage these new GraphQL APIs from a unified and centrally visible solution.\r\n\r\nThey are looking for an integrated API management offering, with capabilities and tooling for all phases of the API lifecycle. Key steps of the API lifecycle include create, secure, manage, socialize, and analyze the APIs.\r\n\r\nIBM API Connect is a full lifecycle API management solution that uses an intuitive experience to help consistently create, manage, secure, socialize and monetize APIs, which promotes digital transformation on premises and across clouds. This means Focus can power digital apps and spur innovation in real-time. IBM API Connect is also available as-a-Service as a highly scalable, fully managed API management platform on Amazon Web Services (AWS).\r\n\r\nThe Focus developers would like to explore how IBM API Connect will support them to manage their GraphQL APIs.

API Connect Enterprise as a Service is a cloud-based edition of IBM API Connect. Using API Connect Enterprise as a Service enables them to work in the cloud to create, manage, secure, and socialize APIs using the latest features, innovation, and industry standards for full API lifecycle management.\r\n\r\nAPI Connect Enterprise as a Service uses software-as-a-service as a delivery model. With this model, API Connect is hosted on Amazon Web Services and is managed by IBM. Focus Corporation pays for using the software without worrying about owning and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. With API Connect Enterprise as a Service, they pay for usage through their AWS bill.\r\n\r\nIBM API Connect enables them to create a GraphQL API proxy definition that proxies a backend GraphQL server. API Connect extends the GraphQL standard by providing, in a GraphQL API definition, the ability to configure a range of settings that are used to calculate the complexity of a GraphQL request and an associated cost that counts towards the rate limit.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.2.1\r\n\r\nClick on the **Develop** menu.\r\n\r\n  ![](images/apic-home.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.2.2\r\n\r\nThen click **Add->API**.\r\n\r\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-5.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.2.3\r\n\r\nSelect **From Existing GraphQL service (GraphQL proxy)** (1).

Pointing to an existing GraphQL server, API Connect introspects the service and automatically creates a GraphQL proxy service.\r\n\r\nAs described earlier in this demo, the API Connect Essentials API is using an API Key approach to control access to the entire endpoint. Because of that, Focus developers need to include the API Key in the Authorization Header section of the HTTP Header.\r\n\r\nThe schema validator reports warning and errors if found. For now, the developers ignore the schema warning. They will fix this warning in later steps.\r\n\r\nGreat! Focus' developers successfully created a GraphQL proxy API using IBM API Connect.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.3.1\r\n\r\nEnter the following values:\r\n\r\n  Title: **customers** (1)\r\n\r\n  GraphQL server URL: [*Your API URL copied from StepZen Dashboard*] (for example: https://wanaka.stepzen.net/api/product-demo/__graphql) (2)\r\n\r\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-7.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.3.2\r\n\r\nIn the *HTTP Header* section, click **Add** (1) to enter **Authorization** (2) as *Header* and paste the *API Key value* that you copied from the *API Connect Essentials Dashboard Headers* section as *Value* (3).

The weighting factor is used when calculating the type cost for a request to the GraphQL API. For example, a field that requires extensive CPU or memory use on the server to retrieve its value would be given a higher cost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the warning details, the Warning window gives an option to fix the warning by applying the limits. While this Artificial Intelligence is often very accurate, for a real scenario it is important to carefully examine the results and only accept them when they are accurate, since this affects the security of your application.\r\n\r\nAfter applying the recommendations, the warning message is removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.2.1\r\n\r\nClick **View** on the *Warning* message notification box.\r\n\r\n  ![](images/apic-edit-3.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.2.2\r\n\r\nIn our case, click **Apply all** (1), then click **Apply** (2).\r\n\r\n  ![](images/apic-edit-4.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 7.2.3\r\n\r\nClick **Save** to save the API definition.\r\n\r\n![](images/apic-edit-5.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>7.3 - Edit Gateway Flow</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nIt is time to explore the Gateway view.

APIs serve as the essential connector between different data sources and applications, which means that businesses are relying on and creating more APIs than ever before to get the data they need power their applications and experiences.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nGraphQL has rapidly become a go-to query language for companies to interact with their data and is emerging as a new standard for APIs, layering upon the investments in REST APIs and data systems. While GraphQL APIs are significantly easier for the application teams to consume, they can represent a challenge to the API Provider teams tasked with building them. We believe that APIs built declaratively are simply better leading to first implementation with fewer lines of clean code, faster time to deploy, and APIs with built-in performance, cost, and reliability optimizations.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFocus Corporation, a hypothetical retail company engaged with IBM, is highly motivated to derive more revenue from first-time customers to their online storefronts. The Focus development team decided to invest in GraphQL as a new standard for APIs. GraphQL is a query language for APIs that gives an application client greater control over what data it retrieves in an API request when compared with a REST API request.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFocus’ developers would like to explore an easier way for developers to build GraphQL APIs, consuming data stored everywhere.  While GraphQL APIs are significantly easier for the application teams to consume, they can represent a challenge to the API teams tasked with building them, securing them, socializing them, and managing them. To ease the process of building these APIs, they would like to explore a way to create GraphQL APIs using a declarative approach for federated access to data.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFocus’ team requested a demo to learn how to move from zero to enterprise in the GraphQL API domain. In the following demo, Focus’ developers will learn how to use API Connect Essentials (StepZen) to create a federated GraphQL API by pulling data from disparate sources (REST API and MySQL). After that they will use IBM API Connect to create a GraphQL API proxy definition that proxies a backend GraphQL server from API Connect Essentials and define rate limiting controls that reflect the amount of data that is returned from the server. In this demo, Focus will see how to CREATE, MANAGE, SECURE and SOCIALIZE their GraphQL APIs using the IBM API Connect solution.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n(Demo Slides <a href=\"https://github.com/ibm-integration/learninghub/blob/main/src/pages/demos/apic-tech-graphql/files/APICGraphQLSlides.pptx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>)\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n### **1 - Setup API Connect Essentials (StepZen)**\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>1.1 - Access APIC Essentials</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nAPI Connect Essentials enables developers to easily build and deploy a single GraphQL API that gets the data they need from multiple backends. The API Connect Essentials CLI is the primary tool for creating, uploading, deploying, and testing their GraphQL APIs. The CLI enables Focus’ developers to manage their API Connect Essentials schemas, configurations, and endpoints. The CLI also comes with a built-in Schema Explorer that enables them to explore and test the API.\r\n\r\nFocus' developers already installed the API Connect Essentials CLI. Next, they need to get the details about their account. For this demo, they are using a free StepZen account.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1\r\n\r\nIn your email inbox (that you used to create the API Connect Essentials free account), search for **IBM SaaS** (1), open the \"**Access your IBM API Connect Essentials free instance**\" email (2).

On this page, under the “Authentication details” twisty, they will find their environment name, the domain, and the two keys they need for API authentication.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1\r\n\r\nOn the API Connect Essentials Dashboard page, scroll down to see the *Authentication details* section. Copy the **Environment** name (1), the **Domain** (2) and **Admin Key** (3). You will use them in the next step.\r\n\r\n  ![](images/setup-new-sz-6.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>1.3 - APIC Essentials CLI log in</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nTo run APIC Essentials in the cloud, the developers can connect the CLI to their account to get a private and secure endpoint or use APIC Essentials with a public account. After installing the CLI, they are able to connect it to their account using the login CLI command.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.3.1\r\n\r\nUsing the Visual Studio Code terminal window, execute the command below to log in with API Connect Essentials CLI, replace [your_environment] with the environment value (1), and [your_domain] with the domain value (2) from the Account details page.\r\n\r\n```\r\nstepzen login [your_domain] -a [your_environment]\r\n```\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n  ![](images/setup-new-sz-7.png)\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 1.3.2\r\n\r\nNow, you need to enter your Admin Key. Copy and paste the **Admin Key** value (3) from the *Authentication details* section.\r\n\r\n  ![](images/setup-new-sz-8.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n### **2 - Build a GraphQL API from a REST API**\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>2.1 - Create your API directory</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nUsing API Connect Essentials, Focus’ developers can create a GraphQL API for backends with REST interfaces in minutes.\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to create a GraphQL API with StepZen when they have a REST backend:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Use the command-line interface (CLI) command <i>stepzen import curl</i> to specify an existing REST endpoint - StepZen introspects the endpoint and auto-generates a GraphQL schema for you.</li>\r\n<li>Write the schema code in a <i>.graphql</i> GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) file. Use the powerful GraphQL directive <i>@rest</i> to connect the REST endpoint, and with just a few lines of code, they have a working schema.</li>\r\n</ul><br/>\r\n\r\nIn this module, Focus’ developers will learn how to use the <i>stepzen import curl</i> command on an existing REST API. This command sends a curl request to API Connect Essentials and parses the GraphQL types from the JSON response. Before the developers build their GraphQL API, they need to create a new directory.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1\r\n\r\nOn the Visual Studio Code Terminal, execute the command below to create a new directory.\r\n\r\n```\r\nmkdir product-demo\r\n```\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n  ![](images/build-rest1-1.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2\r\n\r\nChange to the new directory.\r\n\r\n```\r\ncd product-demo\r\n```\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n![](images/build-rest1-2.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>2.2 - Initialize the APIC Essentials workspace</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nWith the directory created, Focus’ developers need to initialize the API Connect Essentials workspace in their working directory.

For example, a B2C retail business might have customer APIs, e-commerce APIs, marketing APIs, and so on. These APIs are typically built by semi-independent teams, and usually have some common lightweight structures (like authentication, documentation, etc.), but otherwise are constructed independently. And they might appear in the same portal for the API consumer, but there is nothing that connects them.\r\n\r\nBecause GraphQL APIs are designed to “stitch” data together, GraphQL represents an opportunity to Focus’ team to connect APIs easil even those built by independent teams.  GraphQL federation is a critical element of a GraphQL architecture. Federation is about assembling the work of independent teams into one, or possibly a few, uber GraphQL APIs. Focus’ developers would like to see how to do it!\r\n\r\nFirst, they need to create a query to getAddressById in their MySQL database.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.1.1\r\n\r\nOn the **index.graphql** from **mysql** folder (1), scroll down to see the ‘*type Query*’ declaration. Below the sentence \"**Queries for type ‘Address’**\", include the query code below (2).\r\n\r\n```\r\ngetAddressById(id: Int!): [Address]\r\n@dbquery(\r\n  type: \"mysql\"\r\n  query: \"\"\"\r\n  SELECT * FROM `address` where `id` = ?\r\n  \"\"\"\r\n  configuration: \"mysql_config\"\r\n)\r\n```\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\nThis code is defining a getAddressById query to select the address from the MySQL database.\r\n\r\n  ![](images/merge-blocks-1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.1.2\r\n\r\n**Save** the file (File > Save or CTRL+S).\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>5.2 - Create a composition with @materializer</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nAt this stage, they have multiple subgraphs. They would like to explore the scenario of link types across subgraphs with <i>@materializer</i>.\r\n\r\nFocus’ team just needs to change the address field to use the getAddressById query that they have just created. With that, they can easily link these two subgraphs with <i>@materializer</i>.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.2.1\r\n\r\nOpen the **index.graphql** file from the **curl** folder (1), this is the schema from the customers REST API.  Scroll down to see the ‘*type RootEntry*’ section.  By now, the address is coming from the REST API endpoint. Let's change it to get this value from MySQL database. Replace the current address type definition (address: Address) for the code below (2).\r\n```\r\naddress: [Address]\r\n  @materializer (query: \"getAddressById\")\r\n```\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n  ![](images/merge-blocks-2.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.2.2\r\n\r\n**Save** the file (File > Save or CTRL+S).\r\n<br/>\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary>5.3 - Test the composition</summary><br/>\r\n\r\n**Narration**\r\n\r\nFocus’ developers are ready to deploy their new API. Now they can test the new API, by creating a customers query including address attributes.\r\n\r\nFinally, here is the response, including data from the REST API and the MySQL database at the same time.\r\n\r\nBefore the developers move to the API Connections part, to see how to manage, secure and socialize this API, they need to take a copy of their API endpoint and the Authorization header. They will use this information later to invoke this API.\r\n\r\nOne important point to highlight here is about how API Connect Essentials controls access to GraphQL schemas and endpoints.\r\n\r\nAs Focus’ team build out their GraphQL APIs, they will want to add access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized use of these endpoints. API Connect Essentials supports two different solutions for this problem.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>API Keys: they can use API keys to control access to the entire endpoint. API keys are the default access control mechanism.</li>\r\n  <li>Field Policies: they can use Field policies to control access to specific entry point fields on the endpoint. Field policies provide fine-grained access control to their GraphQL API, using a model similar to attribute-based access control.</li>\r\n</ul><br/>\r\n\r\nAPI Connect Essentials provides two different types of API keys for use with an account: Admin Keys and API Keys. Admin keys provide administrative-level access to their account and should only be used at development time. API keys provide more limited access to their account and should be used for production.\r\n\r\nIn this demo, for simplification purpose, Focus’ developers will use the Admin Keys to access their API. In a real environment, they should use API Keys or Field Policies to improve their API’s security.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.3.1\r\n\r\nOn the Visual Studio Code terminal, execute the command below.\r\n```\r\nstepzen start\r\n```\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n  ![](images/merge-blocks-3.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.3.2\r\n\r\nBack to the browser, refresh the API Connect Essentials Explorer page.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 5.3.3\r\n\r\nOn the APIC Essentials Explorer page, use the Builder section (1), to create a customers query including address attributes (2).

Key steps of the API lifecycle include create, secure, manage, socialize, and analyze the APIs.\r\n\r\nIBM API Connect is a full lifecycle API management solution that uses an intuitive experience to help consistently create, manage, secure, socialize and monetize APIs, which promotes digital transformation on premises and across clouds. This means Focus can power digital apps and spur innovation in real-time. IBM API Connect is also available as-a-Service as a highly scalable, fully managed API management platform on Amazon Web Services (AWS).\r\n\r\nThe Focus developers would like to explore how IBM API Connect will support them to manage their GraphQL APIs.

Using API Connect Enterprise as a Service enables them to work in the cloud to create, manage, secure, and socialize APIs using the latest features, innovation, and industry standards for full API lifecycle management.\r\n\r\nAPI Connect Enterprise as a Service uses software-as-a-service as a delivery model. With this model, API Connect is hosted on Amazon Web Services and is managed by IBM. Focus Corporation pays for using the software without worrying about owning and maintaining the underlying infrastructure. With API Connect Enterprise as a Service, they pay for usage through their AWS bill.\r\n\r\nIBM API Connect enables them to create a GraphQL API proxy definition that proxies a backend GraphQL server. API Connect extends the GraphQL standard by providing, in a GraphQL API definition, the ability to configure a range of settings that are used to calculate the complexity of a GraphQL request and an associated cost that counts towards the rate limit.\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.2.1\r\n\r\nClick on the **Develop** menu.\r\n\r\n  ![](images/apic-home.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.2.2\r\n\r\nThen click **Add->API**.\r\n\r\n  ![](images/apic-proxy-5.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 6.2.3\r\n\r\nSelect **From Existing GraphQL service (GraphQL proxy)** (1).

If they make more calls, they will see larger statistic results.\r\n\r\nIn this page, the developers can view information about the APIs to help them to develop new applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 9.5.1\r\n\r\nOpen the **Apps** page (1) and select the **Consumers Application** (2).\r\n\r\n  ![](images/apic-portal-21.png)\r\n\r\n<hr/><br/>\r\n\r\n**Action** &nbsp; 9.5.2\r\n\r\nShow the statistics page.\r\n\r\n  ![](images/apic-portal-22.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<br/><br/>\r\n\r\n### **Summary**\r\n\r\n<br/>\r\nLet’s summarize what Focus’ developers have done today. In this demo they: <br/>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Created a GraphQL API using a declarative approach using API Connect Essentials (StepZen)</li>\r\n<li>Created a GraphQL API using different sources (two REST services and one MySQL database)</li>\r\n<li>Created a graph composition using @materializer</li>\r\n<li>Deployed the new GraphQL API on StepZen Cloud runtime;</li>\r\n<li>Created a GraphQL Proxy API in API Connect to call the GraphQL API on StepZen</li>\r\n<li>Managed their API and set up the security policies</li>\r\n<li>Created a Product and applied GraphQL rate limits</li>\r\n<li>Socialized their GraphQL API on the Developer Portal and demonstrated how an API consumer can use the API portal to perform self-service consumption of the API;</li>\r\n</ul><br/>\r\nFrom a business perspective, Focus Corporate learned how to use APIs to automate a series of steps to obtain customer and order information from different sources (legacy services and databases). They verified how to use APIs as the foundation of their digital transformation journey.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nFor Focus’ Development team, they learned an easier way to build GraphQL APIs and consume data stored everywhere.  At the same time, they saw a complete API Management solution that enables them to create, secure, socialize and manage APIs.\r\n<br/><br/>\r\nThank you for attending today’s presentation.\r\n<br/>\r\n","fileAbsolutePath":"C:/Users/ruffa/Documents/GitHub/learninghub/src/pages/demos/apic-tech-graphql/demo-script.mdx"}}},"staticQueryHashes":["1364590287","137577622","137577622","2102389209","2102389209","2456312558","2746626797","2746626797","3018647132","3018647132","3037994772","3037994772","768070550","768070550"]}
