This demo automates a series of steps to: obtain and validate input information from a customer with a concern; open a case in Salesforce; attach the incoming information to the case; analyze the tone of the situation, and; respond to the customer with the case number and expected date for resolution.<br/><br/>To automate this customer interaction, we will use both APIs and integrations to back-end applications. |\n| **Demo products** | Cloud Pak for Integration |\n| **Demo capabilities** | API management; Application integration; Connectors |\n| **Demo intro slides** | Download the Introduction and Overview slides <a href=\"./files/Aspera for Sellers - Presentation.pptx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. |\n| **Demo script** | This demo script has multiple tasks that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see.<br/><br/> This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery. <br/><br/> You are using a shared demo environment with multiple sellers at the same time. Please don't create custom flows or APIs in this environment. Also, don't do any customization (including customer names). Please just follow the steps. If you need to do a customized demo, please select the 300-level demo option. |\n| **How to get support** | Contact <a href=\"mailto:rosorio@br.ibm.com\">rosorio@br.ibm.com</a> regarding issues with setting up and running this demo use case. |\n\n***\n\n### 2 - Requesting access to the shared environment\n\n2.1 Access the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/account/reg/us-en/signup?formid=urx-30538\" target=\"_blank\">Sign up for IBM Aspera on Cloud page</a>.\n\n2.2 On the **Sign up for our free trial** page, if you already have an IBM account, click **Log in** (A). If not, complete the registration form (B).\n\n![](images/trial-1.png)\n\n2.3 At the end, you need to verify your email. Open your email and **copy the 7 digit code**.\n\n![](images/trial-2.png)\n\n2.4 Return to the Sign-up form and **paste the 7 digit code** into the form (A). Then, click **Start your free trial** (B).\n\n![](images/trial-3.png)\n\n2.5 In the **About your IBMid Account**, check the information there and when ready, click **Proceed**.\n\n![](images/trial-4.png)\n\n2.6 Now, back to your email, you should have an email from IBM Aspera on Cloud. Open this email and click on **Start using IBM Aspera on Cloud now**.\n\n![](images/trial-5.png)\n\n2.7 Click **Log in with IBMid**. Then, go ahead and use your new IBMid credentials.\n\n![](images/trial-6.png)\n\n\n***\n\n### 3 - Installing Aspera Connect\n\n3.1 On Aspera on Cloud home page, open the **Admin** app.\n\n![](images/trial-8.png)\n\n3.2 First time you access the Aspera on Cloud, you should see the **Welcome** dialog, click **close**.\n\n![](images/trial-9.png)\n\n3.3 Now, you will see a page, asking you to install the IBM Aspera Connect transfer client. You need to install both the Aspera Connect browser plug-in and the Aspera Connect client. Let's do it! Click **Install extension**.  \n\n![](images/connect-1.png)\n\n3.4 Go ahead, and follow the necessary steps to install the extension in your browser.\n\n![](images/connect-2.png)\n\n3.5 When done, click **Install Connect** to open the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/aspera/connect/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Aspera Connect</a> page. \n\n![](images/connect-3.png)\n\n3.6 Go ahead and follow the necessary steps to install IBM Aspera Connect in your OS. \n\n![](images/connect-4.png)\n\n3.7 When done, return back to the Aspera on Cloud page. Now, you should see the admin page.\n\n![](images/connect-5.png)\n\n***\n\n### 4 - Renaming your Workspace\n\nBy default your first workspace is default. To have a more appealing demo workspace, let's rename it.\n\n4.1 Click on **Default Workspace** to edit it.\n\n![](images/workspace-1.png)\n\n4.2 On *Name* field, change to **Marketing Workspace** (A). Then click **Save** (B).\n\n![](images/workspace-2.png)\n\n4.3. Click **Refresh**.\n\n![](images/workspace-3.png)\n\nGreat! Your workspace is ready for demo. \n\n***\n\n### 5 - Creating your Demo Files\n\nAs part of this demo, you will need to upload some files. You can decide the size of files that you will use in your Demo based in your network bandwith. One important point: Large files are good to show how fast is to transfer files in Aspera, on the other hands, you don't want to stay in front of customer waiting a file to be uploaded. The recommendation is: Try first and define the best experience for your audience.\n\nYou can create your demo files by using your personal files. Another possibility is to download some dummy files from internet. There are multiple sites where you can download test files, this <a href=\"http://xcal1.vodafone.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">site is one example</a>.\n\nBelow are the names and size of files that we are using in the demo script. Feel free to recreate them. It is a good practice to keep them in a folder with easy access during the demo.\n\n| File Name | File Size |\n| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| A-B Testing Fall 2022 | 10 MB |\n| A-B Testing Summer 2022 | 10 MB |\n| Campaign Launch Video | 100 MB |\n| Campaign Logos | 10 MB |\n| Summer Campaign | 200 MB |\n| Mobile Campaign | 200 MB |\n| New Site Project | 10 MB |\n\n***\n\n### 6 - Defining your Demo Users\n\nDuring the demo, you will need to invite external users to access your files. We recommend to use a real external email (e.g.: gmail, hotmail, yahoo, ...).\n\nYou can use your personal email. But a good practice is to create a fake demo user email (e.g.: fadams@gmail.com), and use different browser user profile to deliver your demo.
