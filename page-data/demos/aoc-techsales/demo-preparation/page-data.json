Then, go ahead and use your new IBMid credentials.\n\n![](images/trial-6.png)\n\n\n***\n\n### 3 - Installing Aspera Connect\n\n3.1 On Aspera on Cloud home page, open the **Admin** app.\n\n![](images/trial-8.png)\n\n3.2 First time you access the Aspera on Cloud, you should see the **Welcome** dialog, click **close**.\n\n![](images/trial-9.png)\n\n3.3 Now, you will see a page, asking you to install the IBM Aspera Connect transfer client. You need to install both the Aspera Connect browser plug-in and the Aspera Connect client. Let's do it! Click **Install extension**.  \n\n![](images/connect-1.png)\n\n3.4 Go ahead, and follow the necessary steps to install the extension in your browser.\n\n![](images/connect-2.png)\n\n3.5 When done, click **Install Connect** to open the <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/aspera/connect/\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Aspera Connect</a> page. \n\n![](images/connect-3.png)\n\n3.6 Go ahead and follow the necessary steps to install IBM Aspera Connect in your OS. \n\n![](images/connect-4.png)\n\n3.7 When done, return back to the Aspera on Cloud page. Now, you should see the admin page.\n\n![](images/connect-5.png)\n\n***\n\n### 4 - Renaming your Workspace\n\nBy default your first workspace is default. To have a more appealing demo workspace, let's rename it.\n\n4.1 Click on **Default Workspace** to edit it.\n\n![](images/workspace-1.png)\n\n4.2 On *Name* field, change to **Marketing Workspace** (A). Then click **Save** (B).\n\n![](images/workspace-2.png)\n\n4.3. Click **Refresh**.\n\n![](images/workspace-3.png)\n\nGreat! Your workspace is ready for demo. \n\n***\n\n### 5 - Creating IBM Cloud Object Storage (ICOS) Services\n\nIn this section and next, you will configure two Object Storage services in different cloud providers to use in the demo to show file transfer between different cloud providers. Because of configuration simplicity, in this demo, you will use IBM Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Both Cloud providers enable you to use object storage service as part of free tier / trial account. The same is true with Google Cloud Platform and AWS. You are welcome to use any Object Storage service. \n\n5.1 Access <a href=\"https://cloud.ibm.com/login\" target=\"_blank\">IBM Cloud log in page</a>.\n\n5.2 If you already have an account, just **log in**. If you don't, go ahead and follow all the steps to **create an account**.\n\n![](images/icos-1.png)\n\n5.3 On IBM Dashboard, on *Search* field, type **Object Storage** (A)  and select **Object Storage** in *Catalog Results* (B). \n\n![](images/icos-2.png)\n\n5.4 On *Cloud Object Storage* page, keep the **Lite Plan** selected (A), and click **Create** (B).\n\n![](images/icos-3.png)\n\n5.5 On your Storage instance page, click **Buckets** on the left menu. \n\n![](images/icos-4.png)\n\n5.6 Click **Create bucket**.\n\n![](images/icos-5.png)\n\n5.7 Click **Quickly get started** to use a predefined bucket.\n\n![](images/icos-6.png)\n\n5.8 Close the **Get started creating a bucket** dialog.\n\n![](images/icos-7.png)\n\n5.9 Your IBM Cloud storage must be in a region that is supported by the Aspera on Cloud transfer service. To view the supported regions, check the <a href=\"https://ats.aspera.io/pub/v1/servers/softlayer\" target=\"_blank\">list</a> here.  Check that you are using **us-south** (A) and click **Next** (B).\n\n![](images/icos-8.png)\n\n5.10 **Drag and drop a 50MB file** (A) and click **Next** (B).\n\n![](images/icos-9.png)\n\n5.11 On *Test your bucket* page, click **View bucket configuration** button.\n\n![](images/icos-10.png)\n\n5.12 On the Bucket configuration page, take notes of your Bucket name (A), you will need that during the demo to integrate your ICOS bucket with Aspera on Cloud. Open the **Service credentials** page (B).\n\n![](images/icos-11.png)\n\n5.13 You need to have HMAC credentials for the IBM Cloud bucket. Let's create one! Click **New credential**.\n\n![](images/icos-12.png)\n\n5.14 Enter **Service credentials-HMAC** as Credential Name (A). Open the **Advanced options** (B). **Turn On** the *Include HMAC Credential* (C). And click **Add** (D).\n\n![](images/icos-13.png)\n\n5.15 Click on **Service credentials-HMAC** credential (A) and take note of the **access_key_id** and **secret_access_key** (B). You will need both during the demo.\n\n![](images/icos-14.png)\n\nGreat, your IBM Cloud Object Storage is ready for demo. Let's prepare the second Storage bucket on a different cloud provider.\n\n***\n\n### 6 - Creating Microsoft Azure Blob Storage Services (Optional)\n\nFor the second storage bucket, you will need an acccount in a different Cloud platform. If you don't have one, you can go ahead and create an Azure free account and use its free tier capabilities. However, you will need to enter a valid <u>**credit card**</u>. It is a temporary authorization and will not charge unless you move to pay-as-you-go subscription. However If you don't want to create a free tier account, because you don't want to enter your *credit card*, no problem! You can go ahead with this demo and ignore the last section of the demo script (Transfer files between different cloud platforms).\n\nAs previous described, here you will see how to create a Storage bucket in Azure Blob Storage. However, you are welcome to use a different Cloud platform, if you prefer.\n\n6.1 If you have an Azure account, log in <a href=\"https://portal.azure.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure Portal page</a>.\n\n6.2 If not open the <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/\" target=\"_blank\">Azure free account page</a>. Then click on **Start free** and follow the steps to create your free account.\n\n![](images/azure-1.png)\n\n6.3 On Azure portal, on *Azure services* section, click **Storage accounts**.\n\n![](images/azure-2.png)\n\n6.4 On Storage accounts page, click **Create storage account**.\n\n![](images/azure-3.png)\n\n6.5 First, you need to select a Resource group. If you don't have one, click **Create new** (A). Enter a name for your resource group (e.g.: myresources) (B). Then, click **OK** (C).\n\n![](images/azure-4.png)\n\n6.6 In the *Storage account name*, enter a unique name for your storage (A), don't forget to take notes of this name, you will use later in the demo.\n\nYour Azure storage must be in a region that is supported by the transfer service. To view the supported regions check <a href=\"https://ats.aspera.io/pub/v1/servers/AZURE\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. For this demo, let's keep **(US) East US** as Region (B).\n\n![](images/azure-5.png)\n\n6.7 Wait few seconds for the review process is ready. When completed, click **Create**.\n\n![](images/azure-6.png)\n\n6.8 You need to wait few minutes to deploy your storage account. When **your deployment is complete** (A), click **Go to resource** (B).\n\n![](images/azure-7.png)\n\n6.9 Now you need to create your Blob container. On *Data storage* section, click on **Containers**.\n\n![](images/azure-8.png)\n\n6.10 To create a new container, click on **+ Container**.\n\n![](images/azure-9.png)\n\n6.11 Enter a **unique name** for your container (A) and set *Public access level* to **Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only)** (B). Click **Create** (C). Don't forget to take notes of your Container name, you will need that in the demo too.\n\n![](images/azure-10.png)\n\n6.12 On Blob container, click **Upload** (A). Select a **10 Mb file** (B) and click **Upload** button (C).\n\n![](images/azure-11.png)\n\n6.13 Let's go back to the storage page. On the *Breadcrumbs*, click on your **Storage name**.\n\n![](images/azure-12.png)\n\n6.14 Click on **Access keys**.\n\n![](images/azure-13.png)\n\n6.15 On **key1** field, click **Show** button (A) and click **Copy** button (B) to copy the *Key* field. You will need that later in the demo to attach the Azure Blob Storage on Aspera on Cloud.\n\n![](images/azure-14.png)\n\nGreat, your second object storage is ready for the demo.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"b02562ec7dffdf01d6e483fada8f95db","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":3657},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fast File Transfer Demo for Technical Sales using Aspera On Cloud","description":"Aspera on Cloud for Technical Sales","tabs":["Demo preparation","Demo script"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Fast File Transfer Demo for Technical Sales using Aspera On Cloud\ndescription: Aspera on Cloud for Technical Sales\ntabs: [ 'Demo preparation', 'Demo script']\n---\n\n\n<FeatureCard\n  title=\"Aspera on Cloud Demo for Technical Sales - Demo Preparation\"\n  color=\"dark\"\n  >\n\n![banner](./images/banner-tech.jpg)\n\n</FeatureCard>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n  <AnchorLink>1 - Review Demo Scenario</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>2 - Create your Aspera on Cloud free trial account</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>3 - Installing Aspera Connect</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>4 - Renaming your Workspace</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>5 - Creating IBM Cloud Object Storage (ICOS) Services</AnchorLink>\n  <AnchorLink>6 - Creating Microsoft Azure Blob Storage Services (Optional)</AnchorLink>\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n***\n\n### 1 - Review Demo Scenario\n\n| DEMO OVERVIEW |                          |\n| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |\n| **Scenario overview** | In this digital world, fast and reliable movement of digital data, including massive sizes over global distances, is becoming vital to business success across virtually every industry.
