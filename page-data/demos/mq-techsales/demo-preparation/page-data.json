With powerful deployment, lifecycle management, and production services running on Red Hat OpenShift, it enables clients to leverage the latest agile integration practices, simplify the management of their integration architecture, and reduce cost. Cloud Pak for Integration demands an OpenShift cluster.\r\n\r\nFollow the steps below to provision a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on VMware on IBM Cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1 To request an OpenShift Cluster on VMware on IBM Cloud, go <a href=\"https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/63a3a25a3a4689001740dbb3\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and complete the form with the follow details.\r\n    Note: if you have any issue to access the url above, copy and paste the url below in your browser.\r\n```\r\nhttps://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/63a3a25a3a4689001740dbb3\r\n```\r\n\r\n| Field  | Value |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| Purpose  | If you are doing the L4 course, select **Practice/Self Enablement**. <br/> If you are delivering a PoC, select:**Proof-of-Technology** and inform the Sales opportunity.  |\r\n| Purpose Description  | If you are doing the L3 course, enter: **MQ L3 Course**. <br/> If you are delivering a POC, enter the PoC details.  |\r\n| Preferred Geography  | You are welcome to select the preferred Geography |\r\n\r\n![](images/ocp-install-1.png)\r\n\r\n| Field  | Value |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| OpenShift Version | 4.16 |\r\n| Storage  | ODF - 2 TB |\r\n| Worker Node Count  | 5 |\r\n| Worker Node Flavor  | 16 vCPU x 64 GB - 100 GB ephemeral storage |\r\n\r\n![](images/ocp-install-new-1-2.png)\r\n\r\n2.2 **Agree** with the TechZone Terms and Conditions (A) and click **Submit** (B).\r\n![](images/ocp-install-2.png)\r\n\r\n2.3 You will receive an email confirming the instance is provisioning.\r\n![](images/ocp-install-3.png)\r\n\r\n2.4 You will receive a second email once the environment is provisioned. You should expect this to take between 30 and 120 minutes. Now the status update changed to **Ready**.  Click on **Reservation ID** to open the details page of your new reservation environment.\r\n![](images/ocp-install-4.png)\r\n\r\n2.5 Copy your **Cluster Admin Username** (A) and **Cluster Admin Password** (B). Copy the **OCP Console link** (C).\r\n![](images/ocp-install-5.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 3 - Access your OpenShift cluster and install the command line\r\n\r\nIn this section, you access your OpenShift cluster and install the OpenShift command line tool.\r\n\r\n3.1 In a Browser, open the OCP Console link and paste the **Cluster Admin Username** (A) and **Password** (B) copied in the previous step and click **Log in** (C).\r\n![](images/oc-cli-1.png)\r\n\r\n3.2 Great, you are almost ready for the demo. Last but not least important, let’s copy login command to access the cluster by CLI. On the top right, click your **username** (A) and select **Copy login command** (B).\r\n![](images/oc-cli-2.png)\r\n\r\n3.3 Click **Display Token**.\r\n![](images/oc-cli-3.png)\r\n\r\n3.4 Copy the **Log in with this token command** and **paste** on a terminal window.\r\n![](images/oc-cli-4.png)\r\n\r\n![](images/oc-cli-4-2.png)\r\n\r\nThat is it! Now you are ready for the Cloud Pak for Integration installation. Take a breath and let's start to install the Pak.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 4 - Clone Repositories\r\n\r\nTo use this guide you will need to clone the demo repo to your workstation. Let's do it now!\r\n\r\n4.1 Open a terminal window and **run** the command below.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/gomezrjo/cp4i-demo-yl.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n4.2 Open the **cp4i-demo** folder.\r\n```\r\ncd cp4i-demo-yl\r\n```\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 5 - Set Context\r\n\r\nBased on where you have deployed your OCP cluster you will need to set up some environment variables to inform the installation script about your environment. Let’s do it here!\r\n\r\n5.1 First, you need to define an environment variable to inform CP4I version.\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport CP4I_VER=16.1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n5.2 Now let's set the OCP type based on the storage classes in your cluster.\r\n```\r\nexport OCP_TYPE=ODF\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Note:` If you are using ROKS cluster, use export OCP_TYPE=ROKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.3 Set mailtap credentials.\r\n```\r\nexport MAILTRAP_USER=<my-mailtrap-user>\r\nexport MAILTRAP_PWD=<my-mailtrap-pwd>\r\n```\r\n\r\n5.4 If you have provisioned your OCP cluster in Tech Zone you can use the following script to set the proper default storage class.\r\n```\r\nscripts/99-odf-tkz-set-scs.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n5.5 Your cluster will also need access to pull the container software required to deploy the Cloud Pak. Your Entitlement Key is used to grant access. You can download you entitlement key from <a href=\"https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary\" target=\"_blank\">My IBM</a>. Click **Copy**.\r\n![](images/set-context-5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">If no active entitlement keys are available, you can create one by clicking the **Add new key** button. If you receive an \"Operation could not be completed at this time\", try clicking the button a second or third time until one is generated.</InlineNotification>\r\n\r\n\r\n5.6 The IBM Entitled Registry contains software images for the capabilities in IBM Cloud Pak® for Integration. To allow the Cloud Pak for Integration operators to automatically pull those software images, you must first obtain your entitlement key, then add your entitlement key in a pull secret.  Replace the *my-key* with your **IBM entitlement key**.\r\n```\r\nexport ENT_KEY=<my-key>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n5.7 Now, you need a namespace where you will deploy the different capabilities.\r\n```\r\nscripts/02a-cp4i-ns-key-config.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 6 - Install Foundational Services\r\n\r\nThe IBM Cloud Pak foundational services operator is no longer installed automatically. Install this operator manually if you need to create an instance that uses identity and access management. That is exactly, what you will do in this section.\r\n\r\n6.1 First we need to have a certificate manager, otherwise,  the IBM Cloud Pak foundational services operator installation will not complete. Let's do it!\r\n\r\n    > Time to install: ~1 minute\r\n\r\n```\r\noc apply -f resources/00-cert-manager-namespace.yaml\r\noc apply -f resources/00-cert-manager-operatorgroup.yaml\r\noc apply -f resources/00-cert-manager-subscription.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Confirm the subscription has been completed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.\r\n```\r\nSUB_NAME=$(oc get deployment cert-manager-operator-controller-manager -n cert-manager-operator --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels.olm\\.owner}');if [ ! -z \"$SUB_NAME\" ]; then oc get csv/$SUB_NAME -n cert-manager-operator --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}';fi;echo\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Wait for a response of `Succeeded`.\r\n    <InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">If no response is generated, **wait a couple of minutes** and try again. Do not proceed until receiving the *Succeeded* prompt.</InlineNotification>\r\n\r\n\r\n6.2 Install the Postgress SQL Catalog Source.\r\n\r\n    > Time to install: ~1 minute\r\n\r\n```\r\noc apply -f catalog-sources/${CP4I_VER}/01-postgress-sql-catalog-source.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Confirm the catalog source has been deployed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.\r\n```\r\noc get pods -n openshift-marketplace | grep postgresql\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Wait for a response of `READY`.\r\n\r\n    <InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">You may be seeing a response of *TRANSIENT_FAILURE* which indicates the deployment is underway but not yet complete. Wait until the *READY* response is received before continuing.</InlineNotification>\r\n\r\n\r\n6.3 Install the Common Services Catalog source.\r\n\r\n    > Time to install: ~1 minute\r\n\r\n```\r\noc apply -f catalog-sources/${CP4I_VER}/02-common-services-catalog-source.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Confirm the catalog source has been deployed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.\r\n```\r\noc get catalogsources opencloud-operators -n openshift-marketplace -o jsonpath='{.status.connectionState.lastObservedState}';echo\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Wait for a response of `READY`.\r\n\r\n6.4 Create the Common Services namespace.\r\n```\r\noc new-project ibm-common-services\r\n```\r\n\r\n6.5 Install the Foundational Services operator (former Common Services).\r\n\r\n    > Time to install: ~1 minute\r\n\r\n```\r\noc apply -f subscriptions/${CP4I_VER}/00-common-service-subscription.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Confirm the operator has been deployed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.\r\n```\r\nSUB_NAME=$(oc get deployment/ibm-common-service-operator -n openshift-operators --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels.olm\\.owner}');if [ ! -z \"$SUB_NAME\" ]; then oc get csv/$SUB_NAME --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}';fi;echo\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Wait for a response of `Succeeded`.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 7 - Deploy the Platform UI\r\n\r\nDeploying the Platform UI allows you to deploy and manage instances from a central location.\r\n\r\n7.1 First, let's install Platform UI Catalog source.\r\n```\r\noc apply -f catalog-sources/${CP4I_VER}/03-platform-navigator-catalog-source-7.2.3.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n7.2 Confirm the catalog source has been deployed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.\r\n```\r\noc get pods -n openshift-marketplace | grep ibm-integration-platform-navigator\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should get a response like this:\r\n```\r\nibm-integration-platform-navigator-catalog-xsm4w                  1/1     Running     0             14h\r\n```\r\n\r\n7.3 Now, let's install the Platform UI Operator.\r\n```\r\noc apply -f subscriptions/${CP4I_VER}/01-platform-navigator-subscription.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n7.4 Confirm the operator has been deployed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.\r\n```\r\noc get pods -n openshift-operators | grep ibm-integration-platform-navigator\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should get a response like this:\r\n```\r\nibm-integration-platform-navigator-operator-6489bb9b7-tcnz8       1/1     Running     0          14h\r\n```\r\n\r\n7.5 Let's deploy a Platform UI instance.\r\n```\r\noc apply -f instances/${CP4I_VER}/common/01-platform-navigator-instance.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n7.6 Confirm the instance has been deployed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command:\r\n```\r\noc get platformnavigator -n tools\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should get a response like this:\r\n```\r\nNAME             REPLICAS   VERSION      STATUS   READY   LASTUPDATE   AGE   MESSAGE\r\ncp4i-navigator   3          2023.4.1-0   Ready    True    13h          14h   Platform UI has been provisioned.\r\n```\r\n\r\n7.7 Once the Platform UI instance is up and running get the access info.\r\n```\r\nscripts/03b-cp4i-access-info.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n7.8 Open the Platform UI  URL and log in.

Cloud Pak for Integration demands an OpenShift cluster.\r\n\r\nFollow the steps below to provision a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on VMware on IBM Cloud.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.1 To request an OpenShift Cluster on VMware on IBM Cloud, go <a href=\"https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/63a3a25a3a4689001740dbb3\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> and complete the form with the follow details.\r\n    Note: if you have any issue to access the url above, copy and paste the url below in your browser.\r\n```\r\nhttps://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/63a3a25a3a4689001740dbb3\r\n```\r\n\r\n| Field  | Value |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| Purpose  | If you are doing the L4 course, select **Practice/Self Enablement**. <br/> If you are delivering a PoC, select:**Proof-of-Technology** and inform the Sales opportunity.  |\r\n| Purpose Description  | If you are doing the L3 course, enter: **MQ L3 Course**. <br/> If you are delivering a POC, enter the PoC details.  |\r\n| Preferred Geography  | You are welcome to select the preferred Geography |\r\n\r\n![](images/ocp-install-1.png)\r\n\r\n| Field  | Value |\r\n| ------------- | ------------- |\r\n| OpenShift Version | 4.16 |\r\n| Storage  | ODF - 2 TB |\r\n| Worker Node Count  | 5 |\r\n| Worker Node Flavor  | 16 vCPU x 64 GB - 100 GB ephemeral storage |\r\n\r\n![](images/ocp-install-new-1-2.png)\r\n\r\n2.2 **Agree** with the TechZone Terms and Conditions (A) and click **Submit** (B).\r\n![](images/ocp-install-2.png)\r\n\r\n2.3 You will receive an email confirming the instance is provisioning.\r\n![](images/ocp-install-3.png)\r\n\r\n2.4 You will receive a second email once the environment is provisioned. You should expect this to take between 30 and 120 minutes. Now the status update changed to **Ready**.  Click on **Reservation ID** to open the details page of your new reservation environment.\r\n![](images/ocp-install-4.png)\r\n\r\n2.5 Copy your **Cluster Admin Username** (A) and **Cluster Admin Password** (B). Copy the **OCP Console link** (C).\r\n![](images/ocp-install-5.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 3 - Access your OpenShift cluster and install the command line\r\n\r\nIn this section, you access your OpenShift cluster and install the OpenShift command line tool.\r\n\r\n3.1 In a Browser, open the OCP Console link and paste the **Cluster Admin Username** (A) and **Password** (B) copied in the previous step and click **Log in** (C).\r\n![](images/oc-cli-1.png)\r\n\r\n3.2 Great, you are almost ready for the demo. Last but not least important, let’s copy login command to access the cluster by CLI. On the top right, click your **username** (A) and select **Copy login command** (B).\r\n![](images/oc-cli-2.png)\r\n\r\n3.3 Click **Display Token**.\r\n![](images/oc-cli-3.png)\r\n\r\n3.4 Copy the **Log in with this token command** and **paste** on a terminal window.\r\n![](images/oc-cli-4.png)\r\n\r\n![](images/oc-cli-4-2.png)\r\n\r\nThat is it! Now you are ready for the Cloud Pak for Integration installation. Take a breath and let's start to install the Pak.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 4 - Clone Repositories\r\n\r\nTo use this guide you will need to clone the demo repo to your workstation. Let's do it now!\r\n\r\n4.1 Open a terminal window and **run** the command below.\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/gomezrjo/cp4i-demo-yl.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n4.2 Open the **cp4i-demo** folder.\r\n```\r\ncd cp4i-demo-yl\r\n```\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 5 - Set Context\r\n\r\nBased on where you have deployed your OCP cluster you will need to set up some environment variables to inform the installation script about your environment. Let’s do it here!\r\n\r\n5.1 First, you need to define an environment variable to inform CP4I version.\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport CP4I_VER=16.1.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n5.2 Now let's set the OCP type based on the storage classes in your cluster.\r\n```\r\nexport OCP_TYPE=ODF\r\n```\r\n\r\n`Note:` If you are using ROKS cluster, use export OCP_TYPE=ROKS.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.3 Set mailtap credentials.\r\n```\r\nexport MAILTRAP_USER=<my-mailtrap-user>\r\nexport MAILTRAP_PWD=<my-mailtrap-pwd>\r\n```\r\n\r\n5.4 If you have provisioned your OCP cluster in Tech Zone you can use the following script to set the proper default storage class.\r\n```\r\nscripts/99-odf-tkz-set-scs.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n5.5 Your cluster will also need access to pull the container software required to deploy the Cloud Pak. Your Entitlement Key is used to grant access. You can download you entitlement key from <a href=\"https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary\" target=\"_blank\">My IBM</a>. Click **Copy**.\r\n![](images/set-context-5.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n<InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">If no active entitlement keys are available, you can create one by clicking the **Add new key** button. If you receive an \"Operation could not be completed at this time\", try clicking the button a second or third time until one is generated.</InlineNotification>\r\n\r\n\r\n5.6 The IBM Entitled Registry contains software images for the capabilities in IBM Cloud Pak® for Integration. To allow the Cloud Pak for Integration operators to automatically pull those software images, you must first obtain your entitlement key, then add your entitlement key in a pull secret.  Replace the *my-key* with your **IBM entitlement key**.\r\n```\r\nexport ENT_KEY=<my-key>\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n5.7 Now, you need a namespace where you will deploy the different capabilities.\r\n```\r\nscripts/02a-cp4i-ns-key-config.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 6 - Install Foundational Services\r\n\r\nThe IBM Cloud Pak foundational services operator is no longer installed automatically. Install this operator manually if you need to create an instance that uses identity and access management. That is exactly, what you will do in this section.\r\n\r\n6.1 First we need to have a certificate manager, otherwise,  the IBM Cloud Pak foundational services operator installation will not complete. Let's do it!\r\n\r\n    > Time to install: ~1 minute\r\n\r\n```\r\noc apply -f resources/00-cert-manager-namespace.yaml\r\noc apply -f resources/00-cert-manager-operatorgroup.yaml\r\noc apply -f resources/00-cert-manager-subscription.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Confirm the subscription has been completed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.\r\n```\r\nSUB_NAME=$(oc get deployment cert-manager-operator-controller-manager -n cert-manager-operator --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels.olm\\.owner}');if [ ! -z \"$SUB_NAME\" ]; then oc get csv/$SUB_NAME -n cert-manager-operator --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}';fi;echo\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Wait for a response of `Succeeded`.\r\n    <InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">If no response is generated, **wait a couple of minutes** and try again. Do not proceed until receiving the *Succeeded* prompt.</InlineNotification>\r\n\r\n\r\n6.2 Install the Postgress SQL Catalog Source.\r\n\r\n    > Time to install: ~1 minute\r\n\r\n```\r\noc apply -f catalog-sources/${CP4I_VER}/01-postgress-sql-catalog-source.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Confirm the catalog source has been deployed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.\r\n```\r\noc get pods -n openshift-marketplace | grep postgresql\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Wait for a response of `READY`.\r\n\r\n    <InlineNotification kind=\"warning\">You may be seeing a response of *TRANSIENT_FAILURE* which indicates the deployment is underway but not yet complete. Wait until the *READY* response is received before continuing.</InlineNotification>\r\n\r\n\r\n6.3 Install the Common Services Catalog source.\r\n\r\n    > Time to install: ~1 minute\r\n\r\n```\r\noc apply -f catalog-sources/${CP4I_VER}/02-common-services-catalog-source.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Confirm the catalog source has been deployed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.\r\n```\r\noc get catalogsources opencloud-operators -n openshift-marketplace -o jsonpath='{.status.connectionState.lastObservedState}';echo\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Wait for a response of `READY`.\r\n\r\n6.4 Create the Common Services namespace.\r\n```\r\noc new-project ibm-common-services\r\n```\r\n\r\n6.5 Install the Foundational Services operator (former Common Services).\r\n\r\n    > Time to install: ~1 minute\r\n\r\n```\r\noc apply -f subscriptions/${CP4I_VER}/00-common-service-subscription.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Confirm the operator has been deployed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.\r\n```\r\nSUB_NAME=$(oc get deployment/ibm-common-service-operator -n openshift-operators --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels.olm\\.owner}');if [ ! -z \"$SUB_NAME\" ]; then oc get csv/$SUB_NAME --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}';fi;echo\r\n```\r\n\r\n    Wait for a response of `Succeeded`.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 7 - Deploy the Platform UI\r\n\r\nDeploying the Platform UI allows you to deploy and manage instances from a central location.\r\n\r\n7.1 First, let's install Platform UI Catalog source.\r\n```\r\noc apply -f catalog-sources/${CP4I_VER}/03-platform-navigator-catalog-source-7.2.3.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n7.2 Confirm the catalog source has been deployed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.\r\n```\r\noc get pods -n openshift-marketplace | grep ibm-integration-platform-navigator\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should get a response like this:\r\n```\r\nibm-integration-platform-navigator-catalog-xsm4w                  1/1     Running     0             14h\r\n```\r\n\r\n7.3 Now, let's install the Platform UI Operator.\r\n```\r\noc apply -f subscriptions/${CP4I_VER}/01-platform-navigator-subscription.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n7.4 Confirm the operator has been deployed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.\r\n```\r\noc get pods -n openshift-operators | grep ibm-integration-platform-navigator\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should get a response like this:\r\n```\r\nibm-integration-platform-navigator-operator-6489bb9b7-tcnz8       1/1     Running     0          14h\r\n```\r\n\r\n7.5 Let's deploy a Platform UI instance.\r\n```\r\noc apply -f instances/${CP4I_VER}/common/01-platform-navigator-instance.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n7.6 Confirm the instance has been deployed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command:\r\n```\r\noc get platformnavigator -n tools\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou should get a response like this:\r\n```\r\nNAME             REPLICAS   VERSION      STATUS   READY   LASTUPDATE   AGE   MESSAGE\r\ncp4i-navigator   3          2023.4.1-0   Ready    True    13h          14h   Platform UI has been provisioned.\r\n```\r\n\r\n7.7 Once the Platform UI instance is up and running get the access info.\r\n```\r\nscripts/03b-cp4i-access-info.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n7.8 Open the Platform UI  URL and log in.
