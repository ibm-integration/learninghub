The Demo Preparation document of different Integration Sales Enablement course uses pre-created script to install CP4I and other integration software. These scripts are available for MAC OS and Linux users. If you are a Windows user and would like to install your CP4I, you have some options to do it:\r\n  1) Request a MAC OS/Linux friend to execute the Demo Preparation script for you.\r\n  2) Try to use linux emulator in your Windows machine.\r\n  3) Or request a Linux Virtual Machine desktop on TechZone and execute the demo script from there.\r\n\r\nThis section describes the approach 3, about how to provision a Linux VDI.\r\n\r\n1.1  To deploy your Linux VDI on TechZone, go <a href=\"https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/638768e537f8a600183c7378\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>. Select if you prefer to make a reservation now or schedule for later.\r\n\r\n![](images/request-vdi-1.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n1.2 If you do not have a sales opportunity, select the purpose **Education** (A) for a 2-day reservation (which can be extended without any approvals) and fill in the **Purpose description** (B).\r\n\r\n![](images/request-vdi-2.png)\r\n\r\n1.3 Select the **Preferred Geography** (A), and accept the terms and conditions (B) and click **Submit** (C).\r\n\r\n![](images/request-vdi-3.png)\r\n\r\n1.4 You will receive a few emails as the provisioning process continues. You should expect the final email to be sent after 30 minutes or less. The final email should look similar to the following.\r\n\r\n![](images/request-vdi-4.png)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### 2 - Access your Linux Desktop\r\n\r\nIn this section, you access your OpenShift cluster and install the OpenShift command line tool.\r\n\r\n2.1 Open the **Reservation ID** link that was included in the \"Reservation Ready on IBM Technology Zone\" email.\r\n\r\n![](images/access-vdi-1.png)\r\n\r\n2.2 Scroll down to the *Virtual Machines* section and click on **Console** button.\r\n\r\n![](images/access-vdi-2.png)\r\n\r\n2.3 Click **Open in a new window**.\r\n\r\n![](images/access-vdi-3.png)\r\n\r\n2.4 Select **ibmuser**.\r\n\r\n![](images/access-vdi-4.png)\r\n\r\n2.5 Enter **passw0rd** as password.\r\n\r\n![](images/access-vdi-5.png)\r\n\r\n2.6 Here you have your linux desktop.
