The Demo Preparation document of different Integration Sales Enablement course uses pre-created script to install CP4I and other integration software. These scripts are available for MAC OS and Linux users. If you are a Windows user and would like to install your CP4I, you have some possibilities to do it:\n  1) Request a MAC OS/Linux friend to execute the Demo Preparation script for you.\n  2) Try to use linux emulator in your Windows machine.\n  3) Or request a Linux Virtual Machine desktop on TechZone and execute the demo script from there.\n\nThis section describes the approach 3, about how to provision a Linux VDI.\n\n1.1  To deploy your Linux VDI on TechZone, go <a href=\"https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/638768e537f8a600183c7378\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">here</a>.
