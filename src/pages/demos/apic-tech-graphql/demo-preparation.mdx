### 1 - Review Demo Scenario

| DEMO OVERVIEW |                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Scenario overview** | Focus Corporation decided to invest in GraphQL as a new standard for APIs. GraphQL is a query language for APIs that gives an application client greater control over what data it retrieves in an API request when compared with a REST API request.<br/><br/>Focus's developers would like to explore an easier way to build GraphQL APIs, consuming data stored everywhere. Take an e-commerce application for example. With a single call, GraphQL can merge data that is found in different subsystems, like customer information, order numbers, and delivery status, and return it in an expected format. While GraphQL APIs are significantly easier for the application teams to consume, they can represent a challenge to the API teams tasked with building them, securing them, socializing them, and managing them. To ease the process of building these APIs, they would like to explore a way to create GraphQL APIs using a declarative approach for federated access to data.<br/><br/>On the other hand, Focus' developers are having problems managing the use of GraphQL APIs in their company. |

| **Demo script** | This demo script has multiple tasks that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see.<br/><br/> This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery. |

| **Notes** | In this course, the terms StepZen and App Connect Essentials are used interchangeably. StepZen was the company IBM acquired, App Connect Essentials is the new name for the product and the terms are at the time of this development being used interchangeably as it is in the CLI and other parts of the software. |

### 2 - API Connect Essentials Free Account

To follow this demo, you need to have a API Connect Essentials (StepZen) account. API Connect Essentials provides an easier way for developers to build GraphQL APIs. API Connect Essentials takes a declarative programming approach (describing WHAT the program does, without explicitly specifying HOW), which results in smaller and more intuitive code, better runtime performance, and faster time to value. StepZen was also designed to be highly flexible. It is compatible with other API approaches and is available as-a-Service (SaaS) while also supporting deployments in private clouds and on-premises data centers. If you don’t have an account, you are able to get started with a free StepZen account, let's see how to do it!

### 5 - Install Node.JS

In this section you will install Node.JS in your machine. Let’s start it!

5.1 In a browser, open the <a href="https://nodejs.org" target="_blank">URL below</a> (1). Download the recommended node.js version.
```
https://nodejs.org
```

  ![](images/install-node-1.png)

5.2 Save the Node installation in your machine and execute it.

  ![](images/install-node-2.png)

5.3 Accept the default values and follow the installation process.

### 6 - Install IDE

An **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is a piece of software that contains all of the things you need to develop, compile, link, and debug your programs. Furthermore, IDEs typically bundle a number of other helpful editing features, such as integrated help, name completion, auto-formatting, and sometimes a version control system. So while you could do all of these things separately, it’s much easier to install an IDE and have them all accessible from a single interface.

In this lab, you will use the IDE to explore your GraphQL schema. You are welcome to use any IDE that you prefer. If you don't have any preference, you can follow the steps below to install Visual Studio Code.


6.1 On your browser, open the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download" target="_blank">URL below</a> (1). Download the VSCode User Installer specific of your OS (2).
```
https://code.visualstudio.com/Download
```

  ![](images/install-ide-2.png)

6.2 Save the VSCode installation in your machine and execute it.

  ![](images/install-ide-3.png)

6.3 Follow the installation steps to complete it.

  ![](images/install-ide-4.png)

6.4 At the end, check the option to **Launch Visual Studio Code** and click **Finish**.

  ![](images/install-ide-5.png)

6.5 You can close the **Welcome** tab.

  ![](images/install-ide-6.png)

6.6 Open the **Terminal** menu and click on **New Terminal**.

  ![](images/install-ide-7.png)

6.7 Great! Now you should see a terminal window at the bottom of your Visual Studio Code. Enter the command below to check if the node installation is ok (as result of the command you should see the node version).
```
node -v
```

  ![](images/install-ide-8.png)

6.8 If you are using a Windows machine, now you need to change the PowerShell execution policies to be able to execute scripts in VS Code terminal. An execution policy is part of the PowerShell security strategy. Execution policies determine whether you can load configuration files, such as your PowerShell profile, or run scripts. Let's do it! On your Visual Studio Code Terminal window run the command below.
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

  ![](images/powershell-policy-1.png)

  That is it! Now you are ready for the lab. Take a breath and enjoy your lab!

### 7 - Install API Connect Essentials CLI

In this section, you will install the API Connect Essentials (StepZen) CLI. API Connect Essentials enables developers to easily build and deploy a single GraphQL API that gets the data they need from multiple backends. The StepZen CLI is the primary tool for creating, uploading, deploying and testing your StepZen API. The StepZen CLI enables you use to manage your StepZen schemas, configurations, and endpoints. The CLI also comes with a built-in Schema Explorer that enables you to explore and test the API you've deployed locally from your browser. The StepZen CLI is available via npm. Let's install it.


7.1 On your terminal, run the command below to install the StepZen CLI.
```
npm install -g stepzen
```

<InlineNotification kind="warning">To install the StepZen CLI, you need to use an administrator user. If you are not using an admin user, you need to login with a root first (e.g.: su -).</InlineNotification>
