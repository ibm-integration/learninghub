<summary>Introduction</summary>
<br/>
The rising adoption of hybrid cloud has resulted in data stored everywhere – in different types of data stores likes data warehouses, lakes, and lakehouses as well as across different clouds and on-premises environments. APIs serve as the essential connector between different data sources and applications, which means that businesses are relying on and creating more APIs than ever before to get the data they need to power their applications and experiences.
<br/><br/>
GraphQL has rapidly become a go-to query language for companies to interact with their data and is emerging as a new standard for APIs, layering upon the investments in REST APIs and data systems. While GraphQL APIs are significantly easier for the application teams to consume, they can represent a challenge to the API Provider teams tasked with building them.  We believe that APIs built declaratively are simply better - leading to first implementation with fewer lines of clean code, faster time to deploy, and APIs with built-in performance, cost, and reliability optimizations.
<br/><br/>
Our company decided to invest in GraphQL as a new standard for APIs. GraphQL is a query language for APIs that gives an application client greater control over what data it retrieves in an API request when compared with a REST API request.
<br/><br/>
We would like to explore an easier way for developers to build GraphQL APIs, consuming data stored everywhere. Take an e-commerce application for example. With a single call, GraphQL can merge data that is found in different subsystems, like customer information, order numbers, and delivery status, and return it in an expected format. While GraphQL APIs are significantly easier for the application teams to consume, they can represent a challenge to the API teams tasked with building them, securing them, socializing them, and managing them. To ease the process of building these APIs, we would like to explore a way to create GraphQL APIs using a declarative approach for federated access to data.
<br/><br/>
On the other hand, our Development's team is having problems managing the use of GraphQL APIs in your company, including rate limits, API lifecycle, security and how to socialize these APIs with our developers ecosystem.
<br/><br/>
In this demo we will learn how to move from Zero to Enterprise in the GraphQL domain. Initially we will learn how to use API Connect Essentials (StepZen) to create a a federated GraphQL API by pulling data from disparate sources (REST API and MySQL). After that you will use IBM API Connect to create a GraphQL API proxy definition that proxies a backend GraphQL server from StepZen, and to define rate limiting controls that reflect the amount of data that is returned from the server by a request to the GraphQL API.
<br/><br/>
Here we will see how to CREATE, MANAGE, SECURE and SOCIALIZE our GraphQL APIs using IBM API Connect solutions.
<br/><br/>
Let's get started!<br/><br/>

<summary>1 - Setup StepZen</summary>

<br/>

| **1.1** | **Accessing StepZen** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | StepZen enables developers to easily build and deploy a single GraphQL API that gets the data they need from multiple backends. The StepZen CLI is the primary tool for creating, uploading, deploying and testing your StepZen API. The StepZen CLI enables you use to manage your StepZen schemas, configurations, and endpoints. The CLI also comes with a built-in Schema Explorer that enables you to explore and test the API you’ve deployed locally from your browser. <br/><br/> We already installed StepZen CLI here. Now we need to get the details about our StepZen account. For this demo we are using a free StepZen account, let's log in here.  |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.1 | On a browser window open the <a href="http://www.stepzen.com" target="_blank">URL below</a> (1) and click on **Log In** link (2). <br/>```http://www.stepzen.com```<br/><br/>![](images/setup-sz-2.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.1.2 | **Log in** with your *username* and *password*. <br/><br/>![](images/setup-sz-3.png)<br/>|

<br/>

<br/>

| **1.2** | **Getting your Account details** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | When we get our account, first we need to navigate to the Stepzen Dashboard. In the Account page, we will find our account name, and the two keys weneed for API authentication. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.1 | On StepZen Dashboard page, on the left menu, open the **Account** page (key icon). <br/><br/>![](images/setup-sz-5.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.2.2 | Copy the **Account name** (1) and **Admin Key** (2). You will use them in the next step. <br/><br/>![](images/setup-sz-6.png)<br/>|

<br/>

<br/>

| **1.3** | **StepZen CLI log In** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | To run StepZen in the cloud, we can connect the CLI to our account to get a private and secure endpoint or use StepZen with a public account. After installing the CLI, we can connect it to our account using the login CLI command. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.3.1 | Using Visual Studio Code terminal window, execute the command below to log in with StepZen CLI, replace [your_account] with the account value (1) from the Account page. <br/> ```stepzen login -a [your_account]``` <br/><br/>![](images/setup-sz-7.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 1.3.2 | Now, you need to enter your Admin Key. Copy and paste the **Admin Key** value (2) from the Account page.  <br/><br/>![](images/setup-sz-8.png)<br/>|

<summary>2 - Build your GraphQL API from a REST API</summary>

<br/>

| **2.1** | **Create your API directory** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Using StepZen, we can create a GraphQL API for backends with REST interfaces in minutes. <br/><br/>There are two ways to create our GraphQL API with StepZen when we have a REST backend. <br/><br/> <ul><li>Use the command-line interface (CLI) command stepzen import curl to specify an existing REST endpoint - StepZen introspects the endpoint and auto-generates a GraphQL schema for you.</li><li>Write your schema code in a .graphql GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) file. Use the powerful GraphQL directive @rest to connect the REST endpoint, and with just a few lines of code, you have a working schema.</li></ul><br/><br/>In this section we will learn how to use StepZen import curl on an existing REST API. This command sends a curl request to StepZen and parses the GraphQL types from the JSON response.<br/><br/>Before we build our GraphQL API, let’s create a new directory.|
| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.1 | On Visual Studio Code Terminal, execute the command below to create a new directory. <br/>```mkdir product-demo```<br/><br/>![](images/build-rest1-1.png)|
| **Action** &nbsp; 2.1.2 | Change to the new directory. <br/>```cd product-demo```<br/><br/>![](images/build-rest1-2.png)|

<summary>3 - Adding a new REST API in your GraphQL API</summary>

<br/>

| **3.1** | **Check the Topology** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Now that the uniform cluster is running, we can proceed to deploy the application that will be interacting with the queue managers. <br/><br/> First, we will switch to the “Developer” perspective. In this perspective you can view the queue managers. Here you will see the tiles representing each queue manager.  |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Back to the **OpenShift Web Console** page, click on the **Administrator** option (A) and select the **Developer** (B) perspective. <br/><br/>![](images/mq-app-3-1-1.png)<br/><br/>`Note` - If you see the Welcome to the Developer Perspective dialog, go ahead and close it.<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.2 | Open the **Topology** page.  <br/><br/>![](images/mq-app-3-1-2.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.3 | Filter by **cp4i** project (A) and show the topology (B).  <br/><br/>![](images/mq-app-3-1-3.png)<br/>|

| **3.2** | **Deploy JAR file** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | For demo purposes, we have pre-created the JMS application that will use our Queue Managers. Let's deploy it.  |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.1 | Click on **+Add** on left menu. <br/><br/>![](images/mq-app-3-2-1.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.2 | Click on **Upload JAR file**. <br/><br/>![](images/mq-app-3-2-2.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.3 | Select **Browse** (A) and follow the dialogs to select the **jmsproducer-jgr-demo.jar** file (B) (check the demo preparation document about how to get the jar file).  <br/><br/>![](images/mq-app-3-2-3.png)<br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.4 | Scroll down and uncheck **Create a route** (A), then click **Create** button (B).  <br/><br/>![](images/mq-app-3-2-4.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.5 | Show the tile representing the deployment in the Topology view. <br/><br/>![](images/mq-app-3-2-5.png)<br/>|

| **3.3** | **Review Deployment** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Now, let’s review our application connection. From here, we can easily check the application log. Great, our application was able to connect to a queue manager and it is sending messages. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.1 | After a few second click on the tile representing the deployment to display the pod. <br/><br/>![](images/mq-app-3-3-1.png)<br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.2 | Click on the pod name. <br/><br/>![](images/mq-app-3-3-2.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.3 | In the pod page go to the **Logs** tab (1) and click **Expand** (2) to get a full view of the log. <br/><br/>![](images/mq-app-3-3-3.png)<br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.4 | Take your time reviewing the log, and at the bottom you will find a message saying “Sending…” confirming the application was able to connect to a queue manager and it is sending messages (A).  When done, **collapse** the log window. (B) <br/><br/>![](images/mq-app-3-3-4.png)<br/> |

<summary>4 - Autogenerate GraphQL Schemas from MySQL Database</summary>

<br/>

| **4.1** | **Explore the Queue Manager 2** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Now that the MQ application is deployed let’s check the behavior with the Uniform Cluster. Let’s open Queue Manager 2.  The pod ending with 0 is by default the active instance, let’s explore it. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.1 | Navigate back to the **Topology** page. <br/><br/>![](images/valid-uniform-4-1-1.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.2 | Select the tile that represent **QM02**. <br/><br/>![](images/valid-uniform-4-1-2.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.1.3 | Select the pod ending with **0** that by default is the active instance. <br/><br/>![](images/valid-uniform-4-1-3.png)<br/> |

| **4.2** | **Review connections to QM02** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | In order to check the connection status, we will use the command “display connections” and we will filter by the MQ App name that is “MY-PRODUCER”. We will execute the command directly from the terminal in each MQ pod. <br/><br/>Right now, we don’t have any connection in this pod. But in the next step we will get a better picture on how the connections are distributed.  |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.2.1 | Open the **Terminal** tab (A) and click **Expand** (B) <br/><br/>![](images/valid-uniform-4-2-1.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.2.2 | Enter the command below in your terminal windows (if your prefer, you can paste using the context menu) and hit enter to check how many active connections associated with our application are in this queue manager. <br/><br/> echo 'dis conn(*)' all \| runmqsc \| grep -i my  <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.2.3 | Show that there isn't any connection in this Message queue (A). Once you are over you can **Collapse** (B) the terminal again.  <br/><br/>![](images/valid-uniform-4-2-3.png)<br/> |

| **4.3** | **Explore the Queue Manager 1** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Now let’s explore Queue Manager 1. Let’s repeat the same procedure as before to select the active pod. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.1 | Right click the **Topology** menu (A) and select **Open Link in New Tab** (B) to keep a window open for each queue manager since you may need to go back and forth. <br/><br/>![](images/valid-uniform-4-3-1.png)<br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.2 | Select the tile that represent **QM01**. <br/><br/>![](images/valid-uniform-4-3-2.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.3.3 | Select the pod ending with **0**. <br/><br/>![](images/valid-uniform-4-3-3.png)<br/>|

| **4.4** | **Review connections to QM01** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Now let’s check the connection status in this MQ pod. <br/><br/>This time we see a couple of active connections, proving that the application we deployed is connected to the cluster. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.4.1 | Open the **Terminal** tab (A) and click **Expand** (B) <br/><br/>![](images/valid-uniform-4-4-1.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.4.2 | Enter the command below in your terminal windows (if your prefer, you can paste using the context menu) and hit enter to check how many active connections associated with our application are in this queue manager.<br/><br/> echo 'dis conn(*)' all \| runmqsc \| grep -i my <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 4.4.3 | Show the **connections** available (A). Once you are over you can **Collapse** (B) the terminal again. <br/><br/>![](images/valid-uniform-4-4-3.png) <br/><br/> `Note` - In your case the result could potentially be the opposite since we have no affinity defined and the application will connect to any queue manager, but since we only have one instance there will only be a connection to one queue manager at a time. |

<summary>5 - Creating a composition of building blocks using @materializer</summary>

<br/>

| **5.1** | **Increase the number of instances** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | At the moment, our application is running in a single pod and therefore it is only connected to one of the queue managers, but what if the workload increases and I need to scale my app. Let’s simulate the scenario and see how the connections are distributed. <br/><br/>Let’s explore the Deployments view of our application. Here we can see there is only one pod. Let’s increase it to have two instances. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.1 | Right click on the **RedHat OpenShift logo** (A) and select **Open Link in New Tab** (B) to keep a window open. <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-5-1-1.png)<br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.2 | Change to **Administrator** perspective. <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-5-1-2.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.3 | Open the **Workloads** menu (A) and select **Deployments** (B). <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-5-1-3.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.4 | Check that you are on **cp4i** project (A). Click on the **jmsproducer** deployment (B). <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-5-1-4.png)<br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.5 | Click on the **arrow up** icon to increase the number of instances to **two**.  <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-5-1-5.png)<br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.1.6 | Wait a few seconds. After a moment you will see the number of pods is updated to two. <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-5-1-6.png)<br/> |


| **5.2** | **Review connectivity** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Now, let’s check how many connections we have per queue manager. This time we should see that each queue manager has a couple of connections. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.1 | Back to the **MQ1 browser tab**, refresh the terminal page and enter the command below again and press **enter**. <br/><br/> echo 'dis conn(*)' all \| runmqsc \| grep -i my  <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.2 | Show that you have **multiple connections** in **MQ1**. <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-5-2-2.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.3 | Back to the **MQ2 browser tab**, enter the command below again and press **enter**. <br/><br/> echo 'dis conn(*)' all \| runmqsc \| grep -i my  <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 5.2.4 | Show that you have **multiple connections** in **MQ2**. <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-5-2-4.png)<br/>|

<summary>6 - Create a GraphQL Proxy API in APIC</summary>

<br/>

| **6.1** | ** Delete Queue Manager** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | We observed how each instance will connect to a different queue manager trying to keep a homogenous distribution, but what would happen if one of the queue managers goes down? Let’s find out. <br/><br/>Let’s check our queue managers in the installed operators’ page. <br/><br/>We could kill one of the active pods for any of the queue managers, but since we have configured Native HA, one of the standby instances will take over and at the end, each queue manager will keep a couple of connections, so in this case we will go ahead and fully delete the queue manager. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.1 | Back to the Administrator perspective browser tab, on the left navigator, open the **Operators** (A) > **Installed Operators** (B) menu. <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-6-1-1.png)<br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.2 | Navigate to the **IBM MQ** Operator again. <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-6-1-2.png)<br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.3 | Open the **Queue Manager** tab. <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-6-1-3.png)<br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.4 | Click on the hamburger **menu** for QM02 (A) and select **Delete Queue Manager** (B). <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-6-1-4.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 6.1.5 | Click the **Delete** button on the warning dialog to confirm you want to delete the queue manager. <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-6-1-5.png)<br/> |

| **6.2** | **Review connectivity ** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | If we try to navigate back to the active pod for queue manager 2, we will get an error message since the queue manager and therefore its pods have been deleted already. <br/><br/>However, if we navigate to the active pod for queue manager one and submit the command to check the number of active connections, we will see all the connections are directed to the active queue manager assuring the client application can continue sending messages. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 6.2.1 | Back to the **MQ2 browser tab**, show the error message: “**404**”. <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-6-2-1.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 6.2.2 | Back to the **MQ1 browser tab**, refresh the terminal page and enter the command below again and press **enter**. <br/><br/>  echo 'dis conn(*)' all \| runmqsc \| grep -i my <br/>  |
| **Action** &nbsp; 6.2.3 | Show that you have **all the connections** now in **MQ1**. <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-6-2-3.png)<br/> |

| **6.3** | **Recreate Queue Manager 2** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Now let’s recreate Queue Manager 2. For this demo, we will recreate using the Command Line Interface, but in a production environment, we can use a gitOps approach. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 6.3.1 | Run the command below.<br/><br/> ``` oc apply -f instances/${CP4I_VER}/${OCP_TYPE}/13b-qmgr-uniform-cluster-qm2.yaml -n cp4i ``` |
| **Action** &nbsp; 6.3.2 | Run the command below.<br/><br/> ``` oc get queuemanager -n cp4i ``` <br/><br/>`Note` this will take few minutes, but at the end you should get a response like this. <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-6-3-2.png)<br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 6.3.3 | Back to OpenShift Console browser tab with the Administrator profile, on the IBM MQ operator on the Queue Manager tab, check the new Queue Manager is ready. <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-6-3-3.png)<br/> |

| **6.4** | **Review the final scenario** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Once we confirm both queue managers are up and running, we can go back to the terminal of the active pod for each queue manager to check the number of active connections. <br/><br/> And a similar behavior would happen if additional queue managers were added to the uniform cluster. The connection would be rebalanced providing a way to scale horizontally. <br/><br/> Great! Here, we have arrived at the conclusion of our demonstration. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 6.4.1 | Back to the **MQ1 browser tab**, refresh the terminal page and enter the command below again and press **enter**. <br/><br/>  echo 'dis conn(*)' all \| runmqsc \| grep -i my <br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 6.4.2 | Show that you have **multiple connections** in **MQ1** (not all connections as presented in the previous section).  <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-6-4-2.png)<br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 6.4.3 | Back to the **MQ2 browser tab**, you need to reopen the MQ2 pod0 terminal page. Enter the command below again and press enter.<br/><br/> echo 'dis conn(*)' all \| runmqsc \| grep -i my <br/>|
| **Action** &nbsp; 6.4.4 | Show that you have **multiple connections** in **MQ2** again. <br/><br/>![](images/rebalance-connec-6-4-4.png)<br/>|

<summary>Summary</summary>

<br/>
Let’s summarize what we’ve done today.
<br/><br/>
In the demo we:  accessed the Cloud Pak for Integration environment and explored the IBM MQ capabilities; deployed an uniform cluster; deployed an MQ Application; validated the uniform cluster connectivity; scaled the MQ application and rebalanced the connections.
<br/><br/>
From an operations perspective, we showed how we can easily scale the number of instances of your client applications up and down, without having to reconfigure their connection details and without needing to manually distribute or load balance them.
<br/><br/>
And here we demonstrated how to quickly and easily grow the queue manager cluster – adding a new queue manager to the cluster without complex configuration.
<br/><br/>
Thank you for your attention.
