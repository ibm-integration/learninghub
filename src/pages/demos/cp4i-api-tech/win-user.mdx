### 1 - Provision a Red Hat VDI


This documentations is only for Windows users, who wants to install CP4I environment. The Demo Preparation document of different Integration Sales Enablement course uses pre-created script to install CP4I and other integration software. These scripts are available for MAC OS and Linux users. If you are a Windows user and would like to install your CP4I, you have some options to do it:
  1) Request a MAC OS/Linux friend to execute the Demo Preparation script for you.
  2) Try to use linux emulator in your Windows machine.
  3) Or request a Linux Virtual Machine desktop on TechZone and execute the demo script from there.

This section describes the approach 3, about how to provision a Linux VDI.

1.1  To deploy your Linux VDI on TechZone, go <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/638768e537f8a600183c7378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. Select if you prefer to make a reservation now or schedule for later.
