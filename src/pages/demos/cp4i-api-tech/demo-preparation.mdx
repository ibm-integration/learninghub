## 4 - Cloning Repositories

To use this guide you will need to clone the <a href="https://github.ibm.com/joel-gomez/cp4i-demo" target="_blank">CP4I end to end demo repo</a> to your workstation. Let's do it now!

4.1. Open a terminal window and run the command below. It is recommended you do so in a directory like `/Desktop` so that you can easily locate the files afterwards.
* First, authenticate your Terminal with the IBM GitHub repository with the following command:

```
gh auth login --hostname github.ibm.com
```

* Within the Terminal window, navigate through the following prompts:
    - a. What is your preferred protocol for Git operations on this host? : `HTTPS`
    - b. Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials? : `Yes`
    - c. How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI? : `Login with a web browser`
    - d. Terminal will generate a one-time code : `copy this to a notepad`
    - e. Within your web browser, log in using your GitHub credentials
    - f. Supply the one-time code and approve access to GitHub
    - g. Wait until the Terminal window reports back a successful `Logged in as...`

4.2 Execute the following within Terminal to clone the demo repository.
```
gh repo clone github.ibm.com/joel-gomez/cp4i-demo
```

4.3 Open the **cp4i-demo** folder.
```
cd cp4i-demo
```

***

## 5 - Setting Context

Based on where you have deployed your OCP cluster you will need to set up some environment variables to inform the installation script about your environment. Let's do it here!

5.1 Define an environment variable to set the CP4I version.
```
export CP4I_VER=16.1.0
```

5.2 Set the OCP type based on the storage classes in the cluster. If using a ROKS cluster, use export `OCP_TYPE=ROKS` instead.
```
export OCP_TYPE=ODF
```

5.3 Set mailtrap credentials, substituting `<my-mailtrap-user>` and `<my-mailtrap-pwd>`.
```
export MAILTRAP_USER=<my-mailtrap-user>
export MAILTRAP_PWD=<my-mailtrap-pwd>
```

5.4 If you have provisioned the OCP cluster in Tech Zone you can use the following script to set the proper default storage class.
```
scripts/99-odf-tkz-set-scs.sh
```

5.5 Your cluster will also need access to pull the container software required to deploy the Cloud Pak. Your Entitlement Key is used to grant access. You can download you entitlement key from <a href="https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary" target="_blank">My IBM</a>. Click **Copy**.
![](images/set-context-5.png)

<InlineNotification kind="warning">If no active entitlement keys are available, you can create one by clicking the **Add new key** button. If you receive an "Operation could not be completed at this time", try clicking the button a second or third time until one is generated.</InlineNotification>

5.6 The IBM Entitled Registry contains software images for the capabilities in IBM Cloud Pak® for Integration. To allow the Cloud Pak for Integration operators to automatically pull those software images, you must first obtain your entitlement key, then add your entitlement key in a pull secret.  Replace the *my-key* with your **IBM entitlement key**.
```
export ENT_KEY=<my-key>
```

5.7 Now, you need a namespace where you will deploy the different capabilities.
```
scripts/02a-cp4i-ns-key-config.sh
```

## 6 - Installing Foundational Services

Red Hat OpenShift Operators automate the creation, configuration, and management of instances of Kubernetes-native applications. Operators provide automation at every level of the stack—from managing the parts that make up the platform all the way to applications that are provided as a managed service.

Red Hat OpenShift uses the power of Operators to run the entire platform in an autonomous fashion while exposing configuration natively through Kubernetes objects, allowing for quick installation and frequent, robust updates. In addition to the automation advantages of Operators for managing the platform, Red Hat OpenShift makes it easier to find, install, and manage Operators running on your clusters.

You can easily check all the Operators installed in your OpenShift environment, by opening the Operator Hub page in the OpenShift Web Console.

The IBM Cloud Pak foundational services operator is no longer installed automatically. Install this operator manually if you need to create an instance that uses identity and access management (IAM). The following steps will walk you through this process.

6.1 First we need to have a certificate manager, otherwise,  the IBM Cloud Pak foundational services operator installation will not complete. Let's do it!

<InlineNotification kind="info-square">Time to install: ~1 minute.</InlineNotification>

```
oc apply -f resources/00-cert-manager-namespace.yaml
oc apply -f resources/00-cert-manager-operatorgroup.yaml
oc apply -f resources/00-cert-manager-subscription.yaml
```

Confirm the subscription has been completed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.
```
SUB_NAME=$(oc get deployment cert-manager-operator-controller-manager -n cert-manager-operator --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels.olm\.owner}');if [ ! -z "$SUB_NAME" ]; then oc get csv/$SUB_NAME -n cert-manager-operator --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}';fi;echo
```

Wait for a response of `Succeeded`.
