### 1 - Review Demo Scenario

| DEMO OVERVIEW |                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Scenario overview** | 	In this demo, you are going to synchronize data between Salesforce and Insightly cloud CRM. You need to have these services and endpoints created and all the credentials necessary to access them securely in the demo. <br/><br/>Both Salesforce and Insightly are CRM systems provided as a SaaS (i.e., they are hosted in the cloud). In this scenario, we will synchronize contact information data between both solutions. |
| **Demo products** | Cloud Pak for Integration |
| **Demo capabilities** | APP Connect Designer: Low-code integration authoring; Mapping assistance |
| **Demo intro slides** | Download the Introduction and Overview slides <a href="./files/CustomerInteractionsSlides.pptx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. |
| **Demo script** | A complete demo script is on the second tab above. The demo script has multiple tasks that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see.<br/><br/> This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery. |
| **Demo authors** | Rafael Osorio, Alan Glickenhouse and Callum Jackson based on Mapping Assist demo created by CP4I Dev team|
| **How to get support** | Contact <a href="mailto:rosorio@br.ibm.com">rosorio@br.ibm.com</a> regarding issues with setting up and running this demo use case. |
