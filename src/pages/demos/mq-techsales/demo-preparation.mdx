### 1 - Review Demo Scenario

| DEMO OVERVIEW |                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Scenario overview** | Uniform clusters are a specific pattern of an IBM MQ cluster that provides a highly available and horizontally scaled small collection of queue managers. These queue managers are configured almost identically, so that an application can interact with them as a single group.<br/><br/>This demo will walk you through the deployment process of a MQ Uniform Cluster where each queue manager uses the Native HA functionality to provide high availability. |
| **Demo products** | Cloud Pak for Integration (IBM MQ) |
| **Demo capabilities** | Message Queue; Uniform Clusters; |

### 2 - OpenShift Installation

IBM Cloud Pak for Integration brings together IBM’s market-leading middleware capabilities to support a broad range of integration styles and use cases. With powerful deployment, lifecycle management, and production services running on Red Hat OpenShift, it enables clients to leverage the latest agile integration practices, simplify the management of their integration architecture, and reduce cost. Cloud Pak for Integration demands an OpenShift cluster.

Follow the steps below to provision a Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform cluster on VMware on IBM Cloud.


2.1 To request an OpenShift Cluster on VMware on IBM Cloud, go <a href="https://techzone.ibm.com/my/reservations/create/63a3a25a3a4689001740dbb3" target="_blank">here</a> and complete the form with the follow details.

2.5 Copy your **Cluster Admin Username** (A) and **Cluster Admin Password** (B). Copy the **OCP Console link** (C).
![](images/ocp-install-5.png)

***

### 3 - Access your OpenShift cluster and install the command line

In this section, you access your OpenShift cluster and install the OpenShift command line tool.

3.1 In a Browser, open the OCP Console link and paste the **Cluster Admin Username** (A) and **Password** (B) copied in the previous step and click **Log in** (C).
![](images/oc-cli-1.png)

3.2 Great, you are almost ready for the demo. Last but not least important, let’s copy login command to access the cluster by CLI. On the top right, click your **username** (A) and select **Copy login command** (B).
![](images/oc-cli-2.png)

3.3 Click **Display Token**.
![](images/oc-cli-3.png)

![](images/oc-cli-4-2.png)

That is it! Now you are ready for the Cloud Pak for Integration installation. Take a breath and let's start to install the Pak.

***

### 4 - Clone Repositories

To use this guide you will need to clone the demo repo to your workstation. Let's do it now!

4.1 Open a terminal window and **run** the command below.

```
git clone https://github.com/gomezrjo/cp4i-demo-yl.git
```

4.2 Open the **cp4i-demo** folder.
```
cd cp4i-demo-yl
```

***

### 5 - Set Context

Based on where you have deployed your OCP cluster you will need to set up some environment variables to inform the installation script about your environment. Let’s do it here!

5.1 First, you need to define an environment variable to inform CP4I version.

```
export CP4I_VER=16.1.0
```

5.2 Now let's set the OCP type based on the storage classes in your cluster.
```
export OCP_TYPE=ODF
```

`Note:` If you are using ROKS cluster, use export OCP_TYPE=ROKS.


5.3 Set mailtap credentials.
```
export MAILTRAP_USER=<my-mailtrap-user>
export MAILTRAP_PWD=<my-mailtrap-pwd>
```

5.4 If you have provisioned your OCP cluster in Tech Zone you can use the following script to set the proper default storage class.
```
scripts/99-odf-tkz-set-scs.sh
```

5.5 Your cluster will also need access to pull the container software required to deploy the Cloud Pak. Your Entitlement Key is used to grant access. You can download you entitlement key from <a href="https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary" target="_blank">My IBM</a>. Click **Copy**.
![](images/set-context-5.png)


<InlineNotification kind="warning">If no active entitlement keys are available, you can create one by clicking the **Add new key** button. If you receive an "Operation could not be completed at this time", try clicking the button a second or third time until one is generated.</InlineNotification>


5.6 The IBM Entitled Registry contains software images for the capabilities in IBM Cloud Pak® for Integration. To allow the Cloud Pak for Integration operators to automatically pull those software images, you must first obtain your entitlement key, then add your entitlement key in a pull secret.  Replace the *my-key* with your **IBM entitlement key**.
```
export ENT_KEY=<my-key>
```


5.7 Now, you need a namespace where you will deploy the different capabilities.
```
scripts/02a-cp4i-ns-key-config.sh
```

***

### 6 - Install Foundational Services

The IBM Cloud Pak foundational services operator is no longer installed automatically. Install this operator manually if you need to create an instance that uses identity and access management. That is exactly, what you will do in this section.

6.1 First we need to have a certificate manager, otherwise,  the IBM Cloud Pak foundational services operator installation will not complete. Let's do it!

    > Time to install: ~1 minute

```
oc apply -f resources/00-cert-manager-namespace.yaml
oc apply -f resources/00-cert-manager-operatorgroup.yaml
oc apply -f resources/00-cert-manager-subscription.yaml
```

    Confirm the subscription has been completed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.
```
SUB_NAME=$(oc get deployment cert-manager-operator-controller-manager -n cert-manager-operator --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels.olm\.owner}');if [ ! -z "$SUB_NAME" ]; then oc get csv/$SUB_NAME -n cert-manager-operator --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}';fi;echo
```

    Wait for a response of `Succeeded`.
    <InlineNotification kind="warning">If no response is generated, **wait a couple of minutes** and try again. Do not proceed until receiving the *Succeeded* prompt.</InlineNotification>


6.2 Install the Postgress SQL Catalog Source.

    > Time to install: ~1 minute

```
oc apply -f catalog-sources/${CP4I_VER}/01-postgress-sql-catalog-source.yaml
```

    Confirm the catalog source has been deployed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.
```
oc get pods -n openshift-marketplace | grep postgresql
```

    Wait for a response of `READY`.

    <InlineNotification kind="warning">You may be seeing a response of *TRANSIENT_FAILURE* which indicates the deployment is underway but not yet complete. Wait until the *READY* response is received before continuing.</InlineNotification>


6.3 Install the Common Services Catalog source.

    > Time to install: ~1 minute

```
oc apply -f catalog-sources/${CP4I_VER}/02-common-services-catalog-source.yaml
```

    Confirm the catalog source has been deployed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.
```
oc get catalogsources opencloud-operators -n openshift-marketplace -o jsonpath='{.status.connectionState.lastObservedState}';echo
```

    Wait for a response of `READY`.

6.4 Create the Common Services namespace.
```
oc new-project ibm-common-services
```

6.5 Install the Foundational Services operator (former Common Services).

    > Time to install: ~1 minute

```
oc apply -f subscriptions/${CP4I_VER}/00-common-service-subscription.yaml
```

    Confirm the operator has been deployed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.
```
SUB_NAME=$(oc get deployment/ibm-common-service-operator -n openshift-operators --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels.olm\.owner}');if [ ! -z "$SUB_NAME" ]; then oc get csv/$SUB_NAME --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}';fi;echo
```

    Wait for a response of `Succeeded`.

7.5 Let's deploy a Platform UI instance.
```
oc apply -f instances/${CP4I_VER}/common/01-platform-navigator-instance.yaml
```

7.6 Confirm the instance has been deployed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command:
```
oc get platformnavigator -n tools
```

You should get a response like this:
```
NAME             REPLICAS   VERSION      STATUS   READY   LASTUPDATE   AGE   MESSAGE
