### 1 - Review Demo Scenario

| DEMO OVERVIEW |                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Scenario overview** | Uniform clusters are a specific pattern of an IBM MQ cluster that provides a highly available and horizontally scaled small collection of queue managers. These queue managers are configured almost identically, so that an application can interact with them as a single group.<br/><br/>This demo will walk you through the deployment process of a MQ Uniform Cluster where each queue manager uses the Native HA functionality to provide high availability. |
| **Demo products** | Cloud Pak for Integration (IBM MQ) |

In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see.<br/><br/> This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content.
