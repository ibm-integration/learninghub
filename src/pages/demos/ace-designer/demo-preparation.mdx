### 1. Review Demo Scenario

| DEMO OVERVIEW |                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Scenario overview** | Focus has acquired another business and needs to synchronize the contacts between two CRM applications. Data mapping is among the most important design steps in building an integration flow. This design-time task is usually the most tedious, time-consuming, complex, and error-prone because it requires deep understanding of all the data fields on the source and target systems. Building a successful data mapping also requires business analysis, domain expertise, and technical knowledge on both source and target systems.<br/><br/>The Focus team would like to explore an easier way to implement this integration using AI Capabilities from IBM App Connect.  |

In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (**Actions**), what you can say while delivering this demo step (**Narration**), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see.<br/><br/> This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity.

### 2. IBM App Connect on AWS Trial Account

IBM App Connect Enterprise SaaS on AWS is a powerful Integration-Platform-as-a-Service solution. Integration-Platform-as-a-Service (iPaaS) is a self-service cloud-based solution that standardizes how applications are integrated. Business technologists, citizen and professional developers, integration specialists and consultants can all use iPaaS solutions out-of-the-box to quickly build the integration flows for sharing data within an organization or with multiple companies.

With iPaaS solutions, organizations can connect different applications, data, business processes, and services, whether they are hosted on-premises, in a private cloud, or within a public cloud environment.

Next steps, you create your IBM App Connect Enterprise as a Service trial.
