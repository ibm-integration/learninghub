### 1 - Review Demo Scenario

| DEMO OVERVIEW |                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Scenario overview** | In this digital world, fast and reliable movement of digital data, including massive sizes over global distances, is becoming vital to business success across virtually every industry. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) that has traditionally been the engine of this data movement, however, has inherent bottlenecks in performance. This demo will show how to use Aspera on Cloud to move the world's data at maximum speed. |
| **Demo products** | IBM Aspera on Cloud |
| **Demo capabilities** | File, Package, Activity, Automation, Admin, Cloud Storage Integration |
| **Demo intro slides** | Download the Introduction and Overview slides <a href="https://ibm.box.com/s/tph26q1zzqhix1t1fkm2ukyc9eqgwdbg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. |
| **Demo script** | This demo script has multiple tasks that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (Actions), what you can say while delivering this demo step (Narration), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see. <br/><br/> This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery.<br/><br/>You will use a dedicated workspace with an Aspera on Cloud trial account. |
| **How to get support** | Contact <a href="mailto:rosorio@br.ibm.com">rosorio@br.ibm.com</a> or <a href="mailto:jaym@us.ibm.com">jaym@us.ibm.com</a> regarding issues with setting up and running this demo use case. |

### 5 - Creating IBM Cloud Object Storage (ICOS) Services

In this section and next, you will configure two Object Storage services in different cloud providers to use in the demo to show file transfer between different cloud providers. Because of configuration simplicity, in this demo, you will use IBM Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Both Cloud providers enable you to use object storage service as part of free tier / trial account. The same is true with Google Cloud Platform and AWS. You are welcome to use any Object Storage service. 

5.1 Access <a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/login" target="_blank">IBM Cloud log in page</a>.

5.2 If you already have an account, just **log in**. If you don't, go ahead and follow all the steps to **create an account**.

![](images/icos-1.png)

5.3 On IBM Dashboard, on *Search* field, type **Object Storage** (A)  and select **Object Storage** in *Catalog Results* (B). 

![](images/icos-2.png)

5.4 On *Cloud Object Storage* page, keep the **Lite Plan** selected (A), and click **Create** (B).

Great, your IBM Cloud Object Storage is ready for demo. Let's prepare the second Storage bucket on a different cloud provider.

### 6 - Creating Microsoft Azure Blob Storage Services (Optional)

For the second storage bucket, you will need an acccount in a different Cloud platform. If you don't have one, you can go ahead and create an Azure free account and use its free tier capabilities. However, you will need to enter a valid <u>**credit card**</u>. It is a temporary authorization and will not charge unless you move to pay-as-you-go subscription. However If you don't want to create a free tier account, because you don't want to enter your *credit card*, no problem! You can go ahead with this demo and ignore the last section of the demo script (Transfer files between different cloud platforms).

As previous described, here you will see how to create a Storage bucket in Azure Blob Storage. However, you are welcome to use a different Cloud platform, if you prefer.

6.1 If you have an Azure account, log in <a href="https://portal.azure.com/" target="_blank">Azure Portal page</a>.

6.2 If not open the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/" target="_blank">Azure free account page</a>. Then click on **Start free** and follow the steps to create your free account.

![](images/azure-1.png)

6.3 On Azure portal, on *Azure services* section, click **Storage accounts**.

![](images/azure-2.png)

6.4 On Storage accounts page, click **Create storage account**.

![](images/azure-3.png)

6.5 First, you need to select a Resource group. If you don't have one, click **Create new** (A). Enter a name for your resource group (e.g.: myresources) (B). Then, click **OK** (C).

![](images/azure-4.png)

6.6 In the *Storage account name*, enter a unique name for your storage (A), don't forget to take notes of this name, you will use later in the demo.

Your Azure storage must be in a region that is supported by the transfer service. To view the supported regions check <a href="https://ats.aspera.io/pub/v1/servers/AZURE" target="_blank">here</a>. For this demo, let's keep **(US) East US** as Region (B).

![](images/azure-5.png)

6.7 Wait few seconds for the review process is ready. When completed, click **Create**.

![](images/azure-6.png)

6.8 You need to wait few minutes to deploy your storage account. When **your deployment is complete** (A), click **Go to resource** (B).

![](images/azure-7.png)

6.9 Now you need to create your Blob container. On *Data storage* section, click on **Containers**.

![](images/azure-8.png)

6.10 To create a new container, click on **+ Container**.

![](images/azure-9.png)

6.11 Enter a **unique name** for your container (A) and set *Public access level* to **Blob (anonymous read access for blobs only)** (B). Click **Create** (C). Don't forget to take notes of your Container name, you will need that in the demo too.
