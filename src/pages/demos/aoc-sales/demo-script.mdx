<summary>Introduction</summary>
<br/>
Today, businesses across industries are facing greater challenges moving large files and massive sets of data quickly and reliably between global sites and teams. Failing to meet these challenges can limit an organization’s ability to meet critical business imperatives that yield increased revenues, reduced costs, improved customer service, and new or improved business models.
<br/><br/>
With Aspera FASP technology, users can deliver live video and growing files as well as exchange files and data sets of any size—from many gigabytes to multiple terabytes and larger—quickly and reliably around the world. In addition, the protocol integrates the latest security technologies, practices and auditing technologies to keep your data safe.
<br/><br/>
This demo shows a typical file transfer scenario between different users in a company. Here you will see how to transfer, distribute and sync huge files and data sets, globally at maximum speed. You will learn how to accelerate collaboration with teams around the world on big data and large files. At the same time, you will see how to automate, monitor and control data transfers and workflows. 
<br/><br/>
Let’s get started!

<summary>3 - Activity</summary>

<br/>

| **3.1** | **Review properties** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | The designer builds your API for you. You don’t need to worry about OpenAPI specs or Swagger editors – it’s all built in. These are the fields we are going to use for our API. Note that we tell our API which field is the key – in our case, CaseReference. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.1 | Open the **Properties** view. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-1-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.2 | Show the **Properties** view. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-1-2.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.1.3 | Open the **Operations** view. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-1-3.png" width="800" /> |

<br/>

| **3.2** | **Review operations** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | The Operations view shows actions that the API exposes along with the data. In this demo, we’re going to build just one operation: “Create Car Repair Claim." We can add more later if we wish. Let’s check the flow logic. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.2.1 | Show the **Operations**  view. Click **Edit flow**. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-2-1.png" width="800" />  |

<br/>

| **3.3** | **Review the flow** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Here we have our demo flow. In the designer flow editor, we can edit and change our flow. We are a car repair company that wants to create an API that will enable customers to send us photos of their cars, along with descriptions of what needs to be done with them. With this information we will create a case in Salesforce. Let’s explore our flow in detail. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.1 | Close the **Request** box by clicking the **X**. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-3-1.png" width="800" /> <br/> |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.3.2 | Explain the flow and scroll through all of the connectors in the flow. Open the **Request** again by clicking the first step of the flow. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-3-2.png" width="800" />  |

<br/>

| **3.4** | **Review request** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Our flow starts by receiving the customer’s car repair request with photo via an API. Designer automatically creates an API “request” and “response” for your API flow. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.4.1 | Show the **Request** box (1). Click to open the **If** step (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-4-1.png" width="800" />  |

<br/>

| **3.5** | **Validate the photo** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Next, we validate the photo. Here, we have a simple IF statement that checks if the PhotoOfCar is empty. If it is not empty, we move forward to retrieve contacts by connecting to Salesforce. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.5.1 | Explore the **If** step (1). Click the **Salesforce - Retrieve contacts** connector (2). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-5-1.png" width="800" /> |

<br/>

| **3.6** | **Retrieve contacts** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Now, we use a connector to create a case in Salesforce with the data from the API. This case is where we store the details and progress of our repair. We are using a hard-coded contact name: ‘Andy Young.' He’s the contact for the insurance company. Salesforce Developer Accounts have a pre-populated set of data that you can use to test. ‘Andy Young’ is one of those pre-populated contacts. Let’s test our connection with Salesforce. Let me change the contact to ‘Andrew Young‘ and test the connection.<br/><br/> The test shows that we don’t have an ‘Andrew Young.‘ Let’s change it back to ‘Andy Young‘ and test again. We now receive a successful response. This proves that our connection is working. Let’s check the details. Here we can see the output returned from Salesforce, including the Contact ID. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.6.1 | Show the **Salesforce - Retrieve contacts** box. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-6-1.png" width="800" />  |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.6.2 | Change the **Full Name** to **Andrew Young** (1). Click the highlighted icon to **Test** the connection (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-6-2.png" width="800" />  |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.6.3 | On the **Try this action** dialog, check **Do not show this dialog box again** (1) and click **Continue** (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-6-3.png" width="800" />  |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.6.4 | Change the **Full Name** back to **Andy Young** (1). Click the highlighted icon to **Test** again (2). Click the **View details** link (3). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-6-4.png" width="800" />  |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.6.5 | On the **Output** tab, open the **Contact1** object. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-6-5.png" width="800" />  |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.6.6 | Close all of the dialog tabs. Click the **Salesforce – Create case** connector. <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-6-6.png" width="800" />  |

<br/>

| **3.7** | **Create a case** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Now that we have the ID that we need, let’s create our Salesforce case. Note that we just re-use the same Salesforce connector but with a different operation and data. Here we can see that our contact ID comes from the previous ‘retrieve contact’ Salesforce Call. The name and email address come from the API request. The connector knows that fields like ‘Case Type’ have a limited number of values in Salesforce – so it automatically converts them into pull-down lists of values you can choose. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.7.1 | Explore the **Salesforce – Create case** box (1). Open the **Salesforce - Create attachment** connector (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-7-1.png" width="800" />  |

<br/>

| **3.8** | **Create an attachment** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | To add a photograph, we need to create a Salesforce attachment. That will be easy, since we just use the connector again. Note that we use the case ID that is a returned value from the ‘Create Case’ connector call, which is kept in the flow automatically. We send the PhotoOfCar as a base64 string and we tell Salesforce that the content type is image/jpeg. |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.8.1 | Explore the **Salesforce – Create attachment** box (1). Open the **Create case comment** connector (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-8-1.png" width="800" /> |

<br/>

| **3.9** | **Create a case comment** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Now we’ll add a comment to the case with the Salesforce connector stating this case was opened by IBM Cloud Pak for Integration. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.9.1 | Explore the **Salesforce – Create case comment** box (1). Open the **Response** connector (2). &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;   <br/><br/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-10-1.png" width="800" /> |

<br/>

| **3.10** | **Respond to the customer** |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Narration** | Here we have the response that we submit to the customer after the API call. This response includes their Salesforce case reference for future enquiries, an estimate of how long it will take to repair, and also how much it will cost. Now that we've built the flow, let’s start it! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  |
| **Action** &nbsp; 3.10.1 | Explore the **Response** box (1). Click **Done** (2). <br/><br/> <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibm-garage-tsa/platinum-demos/master/src/pages/300-integration-api-enabled-application-integration/images/300-api-demo-3-11-1.png" width="800" />  |

<summary>Summary</summary>

<br/>
Let’s summarize what we’ve done today.

<br/><br/>

In the demo we: accessed the Cloud Pak for Integration environment and explored the capabilities; imported and reviewed the automated customer interactions integration flow; tested the flow; deployed the flow into the Cloud Pak runtime environment; managed access to the flow as an API and set up the security and rate limits; and demonstrated how a developer can use the API Portal to perform self-service consumption of the API.<br/><br/>From a business perspective we used APIs and application integrations to automate a series of steps to: obtain and validate input information from a customer with a concern, open a case in Salesforce, attach the incoming information to the case, and respond to the customer with the case number and expected date for resolution.

<br/>

The customer needing assistance obtains rapid response to their interaction and the confidence that your business is handling their request.

<br/>

Thank you for attending today’s presentation.
