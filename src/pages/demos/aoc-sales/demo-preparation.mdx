### 1 - Review Demo Scenario

| DEMO OVERVIEW |                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Scenario overview** | In this digital world, fast and reliable movement of digital data, including massive sizes over global distances, is becoming vital to business success across virtually every industry. The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) that has traditionally been the engine of this data movement, however, has inherent bottlenecks in performance. This demo will show how to use Aspera on Cloud to move the world's data at maximum speed. |

| **Demo capabilities** | File, Package, Activity |
| **Demo intro slides** | Download the Introduction and Overview slides <a href="./files/Aspera for Sellers - Presentation.pptx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">here</a>. |
| **Demo script** | This demo script has multiple tasks that each have multiple steps. In each step, you have the details about what you need to do (Actions), what you can say while delivering this demo step (Narration), and what diagrams and screenshots you will see. <br/><br/> This demo script is a suggestion, and you are welcome to customize based on your sales opportunity. Most importantly, practice this demo in advance. If the demo seems easy for you to execute, the customer will focus on the content. If it seems difficult for you to execute, the customer will focus on your delivery.<br/><br/>You will use a dedicated workspace with an Aspera on Cloud trial account. |

### 5 - Creating your Demo Files

As part of this demo, you will need to upload some files. You can decide the size of files that you will use in your Demo based in your network bandwith. One important point: Large files are good to show how fast is to transfer files in Aspera, on the other hands, you don't want to stay in front of customer waiting a file to be uploaded. The recommendation is: Try first and define the best experience for your audience.

You can create your demo files by using your personal files. Another possibility is to download some dummy files from internet. There are multiple sites where you can download test files, this <a href="http://xcal1.vodafone.co.uk/" target="_blank">site is one example</a>.

Below are the names and size of files that we are using in the demo script. Feel free to recreate them. It is a good practice to keep them in a folder with easy access during the demo.

| File Name | File Size |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| A-B Testing Fall 2022 | 10 MB |
| A-B Testing Summer 2022 | 10 MB |
| Campaign Launch Video | 100 MB |
| Campaign Logos | 10 MB |
| Summer Campaign | 200 MB |
| Mobile Campaign | 200 MB |
| New Site Project | 10 MB |

### 6 - Defining your Demo Users

During the demo, you will need to invite external users to access your files. We recommend to use a real external email (e.g.: gmail, hotmail, yahoo, ...).

You can use your personal email. But a good practice is to create a fake demo user email (e.g.: fadams@gmail.com), and use different browser user profile to deliver your demo. For example, check <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/2364824?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop" target="_blank">here</a> how to use chrome with multiple user profiles.
