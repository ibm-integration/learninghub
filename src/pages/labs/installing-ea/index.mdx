## Lab Overview

A basic knowledge to deliver an Event-led Integration PoC is to know how to install IBM Event Automation solution. There are different deployment model of Event Automation, you can use Event Automation as part of Cloud Pak for Integration or as a standalone solution. In this document we will walk you through applying yaml and running scripts from the command line to install Event Automation on Cloud Pak for Integration. Having a good understand of interacting with your cluster from the CLI is essential when delivering a PoC.

The first main goal of this session is to provide you the knowledge about how to install CP4I using command line interface from scratch. Here you will use a Openshift environment provided by TechZone team on IBM Cloud (VMware). However, you are welcome to use any supported OpenShift environment.

The second goal is to provide some demo assets (based on Event Automation tutorials) to be ready to progress your PoC.

In this session you will learn:
  - how to install and configure a basic IBM Event-led integration solution by deploying CP4I using command line interface from scratch
  - how to deploy Event Streams, Event Endpoint Management, Event Processing and MQ instances.

1.5 Copy your **Cluster Admin Username** (A) and **Cluster Admin Password** (B). Copy the **OCP Console link** (C).
![](images/ocp-install-5.png)

***

## 2 - Access your OpenShift cluster

In this section, you access your OpenShift cluster and install the OpenShift command line tool.

2.1 In a Browser, open the OCP Console link and paste the **Cluster Admin Username** (A) and **Password** (B) copied in the previous step and click **Log in** (C).
![](images/oc-cli-1.png)

2.2 Great, you are almost ready for the demo. Last but not least important, let’s copy login command to access the cluster by CLI. On the top right, click your **username** (A) and select **Copy login command** (B).

![](images/oc-cli-4-2.png)

That is it! Now you are ready for the Cloud Pak for Integration installation. Take a breath and let's start to install the Pak.

***

## 3 - Clone Repositories

To use this guide you will need to clone the demo repo to your workstation. Let's do it now!

3.1 Open a terminal window and **run** the command below.
```
gh repo clone github.ibm.com/joel-gomez/cp4i-demo
```

3.2 Open the **cp4i-demo** folder.
```
cd cp4i-demo
```

***

## 4 - Set Context

Based on where you have deployed your OCP cluster you will need to set up some environment variables to inform the installation script about your environment. Let’s do it here!

4.1 First, you need to define an environment variable to inform CP4I version.
```
export CP4I_VER=16.1.0
```

4.2 Now let’s set the OCP type based on the storage classes in your cluster.
```
export OCP_TYPE=ODF
```

`Note`: If you are using ROKS cluster, use export OCP_TYPE=ROKS.

4.3 Set mailtap credentials.
```
export MAILTRAP_USER=<my-mailtrap-user>
export MAILTRAP_PWD=<my-mailtrap-pwd>
```

4.4 If you have provisioned your OCP cluster in Tech Zone you can use the following script to set the proper default storage class.
```
scripts/99-odf-tkz-set-scs.sh
```

4.5 Your cluster will also need access to pull the container software required to deploy the Cloud Pak. Your Entitlement Key is used to grant access. You can download you entitlement key from My IBM. Click Copy.

4.6 The IBM Entitled Registry contains software images for the capabilities in IBM Cloud Pak® for Integration. To allow the Cloud Pak for Integration operators to automatically pull those software images, you must first obtain your entitlement key, then add your entitlement key in a pull secret. Replace the my-key with your IBM entitlement key.
```
export ENT_KEY=<my-key>
```

4.7 Now, you need a namespace where you will deploy the different capabilities.
```
scripts/02a-cp4i-ns-key-config.sh
```

***

## 5 - Install Foundational Services
The IBM Cloud Pak foundational services operator is no longer installed automatically. Install this operator manually if you need to create an instance that uses identity and access management. That is exactly, what you will do in this section.

5.1 First you need to have a certificate manager, otherwise, the IBM Cloud Pak foundational services operator installation will not complete. Let’s do it!
```
oc apply -f resources/00-cert-manager-namespace.yaml
oc apply -f resources/00-cert-manager-operatorgroup.yaml
oc apply -f resources/00-cert-manager-subscription.yaml
```

5.2 Confirm the subscription has been completed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command.
```
SUB_NAME=$(oc get deployment cert-manager-operator-controller-manager -n cert-manager-operator --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels.olm\.owner}');if [ ! -z "$SUB_NAME" ]; then oc get csv/$SUB_NAME -n cert-manager-operator --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}';fi;echo
```

```

5.7 Create the Common Services namespace.
```
oc new-project ibm-common-services
```

5.8 Now, let’s intall the Foundational Services operator (former Common Services).
```
oc apply -f subscriptions/${CP4I_VER}/00-common-service-subscription.yaml
```

5.9 Confirm the operator has been deployed successfully before moving to the next step running the following command:
```
SUB_NAME=$(oc get deployment/ibm-common-service-operator -n openshift-operators --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.metadata.labels.olm\.owner}');if [ ! -z "$SUB_NAME" ]; then oc get csv/$SUB_NAME --ignore-not-found -o jsonpath='{.status.phase}';fi;echo
